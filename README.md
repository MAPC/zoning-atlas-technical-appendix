# Healthy Community Design Toolkit

> _We ought to plan the ideal of our city with an eye to four considerations. The first, as being the most indispensable, is health._ Aristotle, _Politics_

It is well established that community design and the built environment affect human health and well being. This toolkit provides health advocates with a concrete path forward to improve community health. These tools can be used comprehensively in an integrated approach that examines how well the physical characteristics of a community promote positive health outcomes, or individually to address a specific problem. A wide range and deep breadth of elements of community planning, design, and development are addressed, from how to promote the use of rain gardens to improve local water quality to how to establish municipal policies that plan for a healthier future.

This toolkit is prepared by professional planners with an interest in public health for use by public health professionals interested in planning. It identifies key “Leverage Points” in local community design, planning and development to facilitate the complicated process of making Massachusetts communities healthier. The toolkit fits squarely into the history of planning and public health, an exemplar of the reunion of these parallel professions to improve quality of life. The profession of Urban Planning in the United States was itself a response to the public health crisis created by the success of the industrial revolution and rapidly expanding communities. Overcrowding near unregulated polluting factories along with lack of adequate waste disposal caused infectious diseases and other health problems, driving the need for separation of uses and zoning regulations. Now, public health professionals and planners are advocating for mixed-use communities so that people can be physically active in their busy daily lives.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, “In its broadest sense, environmental health comprises those aspects of human health, disease, and injury that are determined or influenced by factors in the environment. This includes not only the study of the direct pathological effects of various chemical, physical, and biological agents, but also the effects on health of the broad physical and social environment, which includes housing, urban development, land-use and transportation, industry, and agriculture.”`1`

The Healthy Community Design Toolkit: Leveraging Positive Change is designed for use by Mass in Motion partners and Massachusetts municipalities to support and develop municipal policies, regulations, incentives, and programs that promote healthy communities. The toolkit provides many different avenues for action and enables communities to choose those ideas that fit well into their unique physical and social mosaic. Each tool includes a checklist with specific actions to promote a healthier community, along with links to additional information and example policies and regulations. The checklists are by no means exhaustive, and communities are encouraged to come up with new ideas that fit their own needs.
