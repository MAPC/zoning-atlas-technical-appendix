# Introduction

The Zoning Atlas consists of spatial data and associated tabular data for the base zoning districts and the overlay districts of the 101 municipalities in the MAPC region. This dataset is a unique resource for planners, researchers, and advocates interested in land use, development patterns, and development opportunities across the region.  

This technical appendix contains a summary of the Zoning Atlas data sources and, particular to base zoning districts, a discussion of our approach to the interpretation of bylaws and ordinances, a summary of the field structure of the tabular data, and a description of each major field category in the tabular data: Zone Use Type, Multifamily, Minimum Lot Size, Maximum Percent Lot Coverage, Minimum Land Area per Dwelling Unit, Maximum Building Height, Maximum Building Floors, Maximum Dwelling Units, Maximum Dwelling Units per Acre, and Maximum Floor Area Ratio. Full metadata for the Zoning Atlas is available here: 

The Zoning Atlas was assembled over nine years and will always be a work in progress. Its first release in December 2020 is a foundational dataset that can be updated and improved over time and with the contributions of municipal staff and other stakeholders. Municipal zoning boundaries and codes are living documents, and it is our intention that the Zoning Atlas will evolve as municipalities update their zoning.
