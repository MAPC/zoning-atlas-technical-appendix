## **Fact Sheet:** Inter-Departmental Project Review Process

**PIONEER VALLEY PLANNING COMMISSION 60 CONGRESS STREET**

**Goal:** Identify and resolve possible issues during the preliminary planning and design stages of construction and building projects prior to beginning the formal Site Plan or Special Permit process.

**Objectives:** To reduce the cost of the design process for applicants.

To foster dialogue between various departments and developers. To reduce the time needed in the Site Plan and Special Permit Review process.

**Why Do We Need this Strategy?**

By having informal discussions with departmental staff, applicants, developers, and designers can identify technical problems in preliminary designs and discuss ways to resolve the issues early in the design stages. This will reduce, or eliminate, the need for revisions to plans during the Site Plan Review/Approval or Special Permit process, saving both the municipality and the applicant time and money.

**What Issues Does the Strategy Address?**

The Site Plan and Special Permit processes can become a prolonged ordeal with multiple revisions and changes and Board members trying to address issues that are better handled by the community’s professional staff. By having the technical deficiencies of a plan identified and addressed prior to submission, Boards can be free to concentrate on the planning and policy aspects of a proposal. The submission of better prepared and more complete plans can result in the project receiving a more positive reception by the municipality and the public and can lead to a better outcome for all parties involved.

**How does the Strategy Work?**

Inter-departmental review participants are typically the city’s professional technical staff \(from Planning, Community Development, Conservation, Engineering, Building Inspector, Zoning, Water, Sewer, Gas & Electric, Health, Police, Fire, etc.\) and do not include elected officials or board/commission members. Such a process can offer a one-stop comprehensive review of all projects. Many communities utilize some form of inter-departmental review of projects and, while primarily established to expedite the review of Zoning related permits \(i.e. Special Permits and Site Plan Approvals\) some have evolved to review many types of construction and public works projects as well as conducting most pre-construction conferences.

While all projects may have to go through this review process once they are formally filed, applicants should be strongly encouraged to bring their project in at project i its earliest stages of plan development and prior to its formal submission to the Planning Board or other permit granting authority. The mantra of “come early and come often” is sound advice. The primary function of the review is to identify and address problems as early in the process as possible so that when a project is formally filed it has already received the approval of the relevant city departments. For example, it makes for a much smoother Public Hearing if, when the question is asked about traffic issues, it can be reported that those aspects have already been reviewed and approved by the City Engineer, Public Works Director and Police Department. Attending the inter-departmental review early in the plan development process also allows for easier identification of, and more efficient coordination with, any other local or state permitting that might be required. Participation in this process goes a long way to avoiding last minute surprises.

Strategy adopted from City of Westfield MA Round Table Review Process.

### A Checklist for Downtown Zoning

**Three principles:**

1. Calibrate regulatory standards in support of downtown’s brand and downtown goals.
2. Don’t place unnecessary procedural burdens on downtown compared to other parts of town.
3. Don’t suppress the market for downtown houses and buildings; use the right zoning to strengthen it.

Areas of zoning policy to check for needed repairs:

**Zoning Districts**

Downtown commercial area should have its own zoning district, tailored to its needs

Downtown residential neighborhoods should have their own zoning district\(s\), tailored to their needs

**Setbacks and Build‐To Lines**

Downtown commercial: Replace minimum setbacks with build‐to line or a narrow setback range \(min/max\)

Downtown residential: Measure the minimum and maximum prevailing historical setbacks, and set those as the minimum and maximum build‐to lines

**Lot Size Standards**

Downtown commercial: No minimum \(Alternative: Set based on the low end of prevailing historical lot sizes, bringing most downtown lots into conformance with zoning\)

Downtown residential: As a general guide, use the low end of prevailing lot sizes in the district as minimum; allow houses on lots as small as 3,000 square feet – but fit the standards to the neighborhood’s particular needs

**Lot Coverage, FAR, Open Space**

Downtown Commercial: Allow 100% lot coverage except for rights‐of‐way such as alleys OR calibrate based on prevailing historical conditions. If your town‐wide stormwater regulations require incremental improvements for pre‐existing properties that do not conform to the stormwater requirements \(recommended!\), couple the increased lot coverage allowance with reasonable stormwater runoff regulations specific to and tuned for downtown \(i.e. that don’t place an unreasonable burden on downtown properties\)

Downtown residential: No fixed percentage; let setbacks \(building envelope\) determine coverage. \(Alternative: Set based on prevailing historical conditions\)

**Building Heights**

Do not set building heights that would dwarf downtown icons or exert pressure to take down historic buildings. Set a 2‐story minimum to prevent concrete and other 1‐story structures that do not fit existing downtown character

**Driveways**

Do not allow individual curb cuts for downtown commercial sites; use alleys or shared access to parking lots behind

**Off‐Street Parking**

NO off‐street parking requirement for individual downtown uses and sites. Couple with parking demand management strategies as necessary. \(Alternative: Phased reductions within a parking supply management plan, off‐street parking behind buildings, and encourage reduction of curb cuts through shared access to parking lots\)

Allow on‐street parking and exhaust parking management approaches before developing a downtown parking lot; and then only do so where it will not interrupt the primary retail street

For residential units downtown, do not require off‐street parking \(residents use street parking or lots\)

In downtown residential neighborhoods, do not require excessive off‐street parking. \(1 to 1.5 required off‐street parking spaces per unit is sufficient, depending on the prevailing neighborhood character and coupled with on‐ street parking and parking demand management strategies as needed. Properties can provide more than is required if they desire to do so.\) Do not require off‐street parking spaces for accessory units \(Alternative: Require only 1 parking space for these smaller “mother‐in‐law” units\).

**Table of Allowed Uses**

**Prohibit** uses that undercut downtown’s brand identity:

As a pedestrian place – automotive orientation or service, drive‐ins, standalone parking, repair as a fit setting for quality goods & services – adult uses, check cashing

As a place with aesthetic appeal – uses that are unsightly, noisy, or generate unwanted side effects as a critical mass of complementary uses – non‐retail uses on the prime retail street face

**Allow** uses that promote downtown’s brand identity and downtown goals: Allow more than one use in a building or on a site

Allow non‐retail uses in fitting locations: housing in upper‐floors and behind buildings; offices not on the primary retail street front are desirable \(Some towns choose to allow office uses on the first floor in the downtown district so that market forces to determine the size of the primary customer‐serving retail zone versus mixed retail/office districts. For this strategy to work best, do not undersize your downtown commercial zone and extend this zone up appropriate side streets off the main commercial street.\)

Allow outdoor dining & beverage service, sidewalk displays, food carts, farmers markets, gardens B&Bs and Inns OK

**Promote** quality downtown residential neighborhoods and allow some flexibility as resident needs change:

Allow flexible conversions from single family to small multi‐family, and back! A maximum of two to four units in a multi‐family home is appropriate ‐ tune based on the prevailing character of the neighborhood, community goals and lot size. Allow single family homes on small lots. Establish design standards for multi‐family dvpts. B&Bs OK, apply development standards to address impacts

Review home occupations provisions to ensure sufficient flexibility and minimize impacts to neighborhood Allow small accessory units \(e.g. &lt;900 sq. ft\) with reduced parking requirements on SF residential properties

**Development Standards**

Apply quality development standards in downtown commercial areas:

Buffering ‐ No suburban‐style buffering between different uses; apply quality development standards for compatible development, and screen utility/vehicular areas Landscaping: Apply no requirement on individual sites. Apply downtown‐appropriate standards: planters and flowerboxes, street trees in public space – implemented through a town master plan

Screening: Site dumpsters, recycling, grease receptacles, HVAC, & loading areas at rear alley or along rear street where they are physically screened by buildings from view \(if not, use wall or vegetative screening\)

Signage: No monument signs except special/civic sites; OK types include pole, wall‐mounted, window lettering, shingle, A‐frame signboards on sidewalks

Apply sensible rules to outdoor display: maintain 3’‐ 4’ clear zone on sidewalk, bring items inside daily, no boxes/pallets

**Zoning Procedures and Permitting**

Do not make downtown subject to overly extensive procedures. Under no circumstances make downtown subject to more uncertain procedures than other zoning districts. As a general rule, enact correct standards, and then allow development by‐right pursuant to ****those standards. Streamline multiple permits, use pre‐ submission meetings, employ administrative approvals for small projects

Never require exceptions, appeals, special staff determinations, etc. to allow downtown to develop according to its correct setting. Instead, calibrate the standards correctly for downtown to begin with, so that development can take place by‐right whenever possible. Don’t rezone or extend infrastructure to create general commercial areas that will compete with downtown for similar tenants and customers. If you have a general commercial district next to downtown, relegate auto uses to this area and minimize overlaps in allowed uses between downtown and general commercial.
