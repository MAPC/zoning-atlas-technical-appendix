# Spatial Data

The Zoning Atlas has comprehensive spatial data for the base zoning districts of the 101 municipalities in the MAPC region, and, as of December 2020, spatial data for 272 overlay districts across 60 municipalities. Once comprehensive, the spatial data for overlay districts may never include all municipalities in the MAPC region, as some municipalities may not use overlay districts. 

Most of the spatial data in the Zoning Atlas was provided by representatives of cities and towns in the MAPC region following requests by MAPC. A few municipalities make their spatial data available to download online; in these instances, we downloaded the data independently. When municipal representatives were unresponsive to MAPC’s requests, and data was not available to download online, MAPC reviewed internal files for any past planning projects with that municipality that referenced zoning data.  In instances where these three pathways did not yield spatial data for the base zoning districts, or when a municipal representative confirmed that more recent data did not exist, MAPC relied on the spatial data collected by MassGIS in 1999. MAPC supplemented spatial data for overlay districts with data provided to MAPC by the Department of Housing and Community Development \(DHCD\) on 40R zoning districts. DHCD’s 40R spatial data is current to 2017. 

The Date Spatial Data Received \(`SPATIALREC`\) field in the tabular data describes the date MAPC staff first accessed the spatial data published to the Atlas.
