# Floor-area Ratio

### Floor-area Ratio \(`FAR`\) 

* Associated Fields: FAR\_SPEC, FAR\_OVE, FAR\_CALC, FAR\_EFF 
* Value Referenced In: MXDU\_CALC2, DUpAC\_CALC2 

This field catalogues the maximum FAR allowed in a zone by-right. This allows a standardized comparison of density across zones that allow non-residential uses.  

Approximately 60% of the zones in the Atlas where non-residential uses are allowed by-right \(ZO\_USETY 2 and 3\) have an FAR sourced from a Bylaw or Ordinance; the same is true for approximately 35% of the zones where only residential uses are allowed by-right \(ZO\_USETY 1\). 

MAPC estimated FAR for zones without a specified FAR where non-residential development is allowed by-right by multiplying maximum percent lot coverage by maximum floors. We were able to estimate FAR for about 50% of these zones using values specified in the Bylaw or Ordinance, the PCTLOTCOV and MXFLRS fields, but did use estimated reference values, PLC\_EFF and MXFL\_EFF, for about 40%. The outstanding 10% of zones required a manual calculation because it was not possible to estimate percent lot coverage and maximum floors.
