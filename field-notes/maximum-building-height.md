# Maximum Building Height

### Maximum Building Height \(`MAXHEIGHT`\)  

* Associated Fields: MXHT\_SPEC, MXHT\_CALC, MXHT\_EFF, MXHT\_ESVAL 
* Value Referenced In: MXFL\_CALC 

This field catalogues the maximum allowable building height in feet. As with the other dimensional regulations, the published value in the Atlas corresponds with the dimensional regulations of the greatest density use. 

MAXHEIGHT is populated for approximately 80% of the zones in the Atlas. Where MAXHEIGHT was not specified in the Bylaw or Ordinance, MAPC provided an estimate in the Calculated Maximum Height \(MXHT\_CALC\) field by multiplying the value in the Maximum Floors field by 10 feet and rounding down. MAXHEIGHT is used to estimate of Maximum Building Floors.
