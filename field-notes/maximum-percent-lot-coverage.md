# Maximum Percent Lot Coverage

### Maximum Percent Lot Coverage \(`PCTLOTCOV`\) 

* Associated Fields: PLC\_SPEC, PLC\_OVE, PLC\_CALC, PLC\_EFF, PLC\_ESVAL 
* Value Referenced In: FAR\_CALC 

This field catalogues the maximum amount of the lot that can be covered by structures, as a percentage of the lot. As with the other dimensional regulations, the published value in the Atlas corresponds with the dimensional regulations of the greatest density use. 

PCTLOTCOV is populated for approximately 60% of the zones in the Atlas. For the 40% of zones without a specified PCTLOTCOV, MAPC estimated this value as 100%. There are 20 instances where this estimate is superseded by an Override Value that draws on minimum setbacks.
