# Maximum Percent Lot Coverage

### Maximum Percent Lot Coverage \(`PCTLOTCOV`\) 

* Associated Fields: `PLC_SPEC`, `PLC_OVE`, `PLC_CALC`, `PLC_EFF`, `PLC_ESVAL` 
* Value Referenced In: `FAR_CALC` 

This field catalogs the maximum amount of the lot that can be covered by structures, as a percentage of the lot. As with other dimensional regulations in the Zoning Atlas, the published value corresponds with the dimensional regulations of the greatest density use. 

{% hint style="info" %}
`PCTLOTCOV` is populated for approximately 60% of the zones in the Atlas. For the 40% of zones without a specified `PCTLOTCOV`, MAPC estimated this value as 100%. There are 20 instances where this estimate is superseded by an Override Value that draws on minimum setbacks.
