# Maximum Percent Lot Coverage

### Maximum Percent Lot Coverage \(`PCTLOTCOV`\) 

* Associated Fields: PLC\_SPEC, PLC\_OVE, PLC\_CALC, PLC\_EFF, PLC\_ESVAL 
* Value Referenced In: FAR\_CALC 

This field catalogs the maximum amount of the lot that can be covered by structures, as a percentage of the lot. As with other dimensional regulations in the Zoning Atlas, the published value corresponds with the dimensional regulations of the greatest density use. 

{% hint style="info" %}
PCTLOTCOV is populated for approximately 60% of the zones in the Atlas. For the 40% of zones without a specified PCTLOTCOV, MAPC estimated this value as 100%. There are 20 instances where this estimate is superseded by an Override Value that draws on minimum setbacks.
