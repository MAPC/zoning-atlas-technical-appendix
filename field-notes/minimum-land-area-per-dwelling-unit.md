# Minimum Land Area per Dwelling Unit

### Minimum Land Area per Dwelling Unit \(`LApDU`\) 

* Associated Fields: `LApDU_SPEC` 
* Value Referenced In: `MNLS_CALC`, `MXDU_CALC1` 

This field catalogs the minimum amount of lot area required for each dwelling unit on a lot in square feet. As with other dimensional regulations in the Zoning Atlas, the published value corresponds with the dimensional regulations of the greatest density use. 

As with the `MINLOTSIZE` field, we found several zones with tiered `LApDU`, where the first dwelling units on the lot had a certain requirement, and additional dwelling units had a different requirement. For example, an `LApDU` of 6,000SF plus 1,250SF for each dwelling unit more than 1. In these instances, we selected the requirement that was applicable to the greatest number of dwelling units \(1,250SF\). 

{% hint style="info" %}
`LApDU` is populated for approximately 40% of the zones in the Atlas where residential development is allowed by-right. There is not currently a field where unspecified values are estimated.
