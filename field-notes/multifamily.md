# Multifamily Housing

### Multifamily \(`MULFAM2`, `MULFAM3_4`, `MULFAM5_19`, `MULFAM20_`\) 

These four fields describe whether multifamily housing is allowed on a lot within a given zone, and if so, whether this housing is allowed by \(1\) Special Permit or \(2\) By-right. The four multifamily fields use this structure for different housing unit thresholds: 2 or more units \(MULFAM2\), 3 to 4 units \(MULFAM3\_4\), 5 to 19 units \(MULFAM5\_19\) and 20 or more units \(MULFAM20\_\). The multifamily fields are the only fields in the database that capture special permit information. 

In populating the MULTIFAM field, we found several zones where multifamily housing was allowed by-right, but only in unique instances, such as in a conversion of an existing single-family home to a two-family home or when the occupants of the building were elderly and low-income. MAPC generally did not classify these zones as by-right multifamily zones because multifamily housing was not universally permitted.
