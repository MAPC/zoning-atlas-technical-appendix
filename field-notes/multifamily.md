# Multifamily

### Multifamily \(`MULTIFAM`\) 

This field describes whether two or more residential units are allowed on a lot within a given zone, and if so, whether they are allowed by \(1\) Special Permit or \(2\) By-right. It is currently the only field in the database that captures special permit information. Importantly, MULTIFAM uses two residential units as the threshold for a multifamily use, so many zones that are not described as multifamily zones in the bylaw or ordinance are classified as such in the Atlas. 

In populating the MULTIFAM field, we found several zones where two or more units were allowed by-right but only in unique instances, such as in a conversion of an existing single-family home to a two-family home or when the occupants of the building were elderly and low-income. MAPC generally did not classify these zones as by-right multifamily zones because two or more residential units were not universally permitted.
