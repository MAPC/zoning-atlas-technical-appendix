# Zone Use Type

### Zone Use Type \(`ZO_USETY`\)

This field describes what uses – \(1\) Residential, \(2\) Non-residential, \(3\) Residential and Non-residential, or \(4\) Open Space – are allowed in the zone by-right, regardless of the zone name or zone description. 

> Example: An industrial zone where industrial uses and housing are allowed by-right would be classified as \(3\) Residential and Non-residential, because residential uses are permitted.

Our interpretation also privileges residential and non-residential uses over open space, so the only zones classified as \(4\) Open Space on the map allow neither \(1\) Residential nor \(2\) Non-residential uses by right. Our interpretation does not account for institutional uses in the non-residential class, as these are most often allowed in all zones.
