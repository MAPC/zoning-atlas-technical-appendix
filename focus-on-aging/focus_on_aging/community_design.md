# Community Design and Health

There is a growing body of research that links community design to health outcomes. The benefits of clean air and clean water are well known, as are the benefits of physical activity, but there are a great many connections between community design and human health that are not as widely recognized. A walk in the park not only exercises the body, but also relaxes the mind,`3` reduces brain fatigue,`4` and increases the ability to maintain focus on specific tasks.`5` Introducing greenery to urban areas has also been shown to clean the air we breathe,`6` reduce and clean stormwater runoff \(keeping nearby water bodies cleaner\),`7` and reduce elevated outdoor temperatures that occur in developed areas.`8` Greener parts of inner cities have also been shown to feel safer and to have reduced crime \(provided that vegetation does not block views\).`9`

A great deal of research has been done on the subject of transportation planning and its relationship to injury reduction, showing that streets can be made significantly safer for pedestrians and cyclists when traffic calming measures are implemented, speed limits are enforced and all road users learn to share the space.`10` Reduced traffic also improves mental health and social outcomes. Studies have shown that children who live on streets with less traffic have more friends,`11` and more time outdoors can lead to more chances for social interaction.

In Jane Jacobs’ classic book, _The Death and Life of Great American Cities_, she argued that walkable neighborhoods with higher densities, mixed-uses, and a significant public realm bring people out onto the streets, leading to greater safety through more “eyes on the street”, as well as an increase in social networks and community trust. One study found that a feeling of safety affects health, as evidenced by a higher prevalence of obesity in women who live in areas where they do not feel safe.`12` In another study, it was found that porches and other architectural features that promote viewing of the street from the exterior of a building have a positive impact on perceived social capital \(connections within and between social networks\).`13`

Having a healthy community for children to grow up in is one of society’s biggest concerns. Being able to walk or bike to school or to a friend’s house independently can help build competence and, by extension, self-confidence. In addition, one study found that children who cycle or walk to school perform measurably better on tasks demanding concentration, such as solving puzzles, and that these effects last for up to four hours after children arrive at school.`14` Another study found that children who live in neighborhoods in which they can walk to school, the library, and nearby supermarkets with healthy food are 59 percent less likely to be obese than children in neighborhoods without these characteristics.`15`

“The built environment presents both opportunities for and barriers to participation in physical activity, thereby influencing whether or not we exercise. Research by CDC and others has indicated that two of the main reasons for not exercising are lack of structures or facilities \(such as sidewalks and parks\) and fears about safety.” —R. Jackson, et al., _Healthy Environment: The Impact of the Built Environment on Public Health_, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2001.

The physical environment plays a powerful role in shaping the choices we make every day and can create impacts that we do not always perceive. For example, development patterns that include large amounts of parking affect transportation choices. Destinations become further apart, making it more difficult and less pleasant to walk or bike, as well as less efficient to provide transit service. More people choose to drive for more of their daily trips, leading to increased air pollution and decreased physical activity.

Access to healthy food also plays a significant role in the health of a community. Living closer to a supermarket leads to lower rates of obesity and diabetes.`16` In one study, the rate of overweight, obese and hypertensive people dropped by 9 percent, 24 percent and 12 percent respectively when compared to people who did not live near a supermarket.`17`
