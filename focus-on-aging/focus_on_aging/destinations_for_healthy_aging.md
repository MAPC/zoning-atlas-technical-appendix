# Destinations for Healthy Aging

Older adults utilize a wide variety of goods and services in their communities. Trips out of the home to destinations like stores, banks, healthcare facilities, senior centers, churches and cafes are a key component of staying active and engaged in one’s life and community. As we discussed regarding housing for older adults, the built environment in many communities makes accessing destinations unsafe or inconvenient for some older adults. Our car-centered transportation system and lack of public investment in pedestrian infrastructure are partly to blame for this, but more fundamental is the basic land-use pattern of many communities and a general lack of attention to site design for healthy aging. We will address transportation issues in the section “[Focus on Aging: Transportation](focus_on_aging_transportation.md).” In this section we will discuss how to remedy some of the broader land use pattern and site design issues.

Zoning-based separation of uses \(housing from commercial from industrial, etc.\) has created the land use pattern in many communities. Some zoning codes prevent destinations of interest to older adults from developing in locations that would be convenient to older adults. The uses may be explicitly not allowed, or they may be made infeasible by excessive requirements for lot area, parking, etc. Doctor’s offices for example may be required to have excessive amounts of on-site parking which effectively prevent them from locating in higher density areas where land is generally less available and more expensive. It is worth reviewing a community’s zoning code to determine whether it encourages or discourages the kinds of destinations desired by older adults.

Destinations of interest to older adults may be allowed, but only in locations that are far from where older adults live. When housing is far from destinations, the trip between them becomes inherently longer and more difficult, often to the point where walking, using a wheelchair, or biking is not feasible. Mixed-use development that provides destinations in close proximity to housing is one of the best enablers of healthy aging. It makes the healthy choice—walking, using a wheel chair, walker or cane, for daily needs—the easy choice.

In places where combining housing and commercial uses in the same or adjacent buildings is not desirable, small neighborhood commercial centers can be inserted into existing housing-only neighborhoods. These targeted neighborhood centers replicate historical town development patterns and are typically located at key intersections. For older adults, they provide convenience, motivation to get out of the house, a destination to walk to, and can reduce isolation.

Older adults, especially those with mobility impairments, benefit from destinations where they can fulfill multiple goals in close proximity—i.e. when the bank is next to the food store, is next to the pharmacy, is next to the post office.`52` This enables an older person to park once and make short walking trips to accomplish their goals. Park-once destinations can be set within traditional downtown or neighborhood center settings. They can also be located along auto-oriented strips if they are designed to facilitate pedestrian circulation within the complex. The key design features for park-once destinations for older adults are: parking very close to a variety of destinations, safe sidewalks between destinations, and destinations that are close to one another. These goals can be difficult to achieve with large footprint stores \(like a Wal-Mart or full-sized supermarket\) because the length along the front of just one store can exhaust an older person with mobility or stamina limitations.

Once an older person arrives at a destination, the site design becomes very important. Parking lots should be laid out so that they have obvious circulation patterns with directional arrows indicating how to navigate them. Due to reduced peripheral vision and slower reaction times, many older adults prefer angled parking instead of 90 degree parking or parallel parking.

However this desire can conflict with the goals of getting parking close to destinations, minimizing paved areas, and clear circulation. Older adults are often more sensitive to heat, so parking areas should be well shaded by trees. About 14 percent of people over 65 experience some trouble seeing. This increases to 23% for people over 85.`53` Vision changes include a need for more light in dark situations, increased sensitivity to glare, and decreased perception of contrast.54 Sites can be designed to accommodate these common vision changes. Instead of having a small number of very bright fixtures, a larger number of less powerful fixtures can provide a more even quality of light. Fixtures should be placed and focused to minimize glare.

Changes in level, like from a parking lot to a walkway or a speed hump, should be highlighted with contrasting colors and larger print. Sidewalks should provide clear and safe routes throughout parking lots and lead efficiently to the entrances of destinations. Benches protected from extreme weather are quite valuable, as are public bathrooms.

When advocating for site design for healthy aging it is important to note that there can be conflicts between the needs of older adults and broader healthy community design goals. For example, healthy community design proponents would generally advocate for restricting parking to the side or behind buildings to improve the pedestrian environment along the street.

However, this can present barriers to older adults by increasing the distance from parking to a building entrance \(assuming the entrance is on the street side of a building\). Some green infrastructure techniques like bio-retention planters can limit the free movement of pedestrians from the street to the sidewalk. This can present a barrier to mobility or vision impaired older adults. Cobbled or brick sidewalks, streets, and paths are aesthetically pleasing—especially in historic districts—but can create tripping hazards. In community design, it is important to remain sensitive to competing priorities and to be aware of the physical and demographic context in which you are working.

## **Key Leverage Points** 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Mixed-use zoning \(zoning\)**

Zoning codes should allow for horizontal and vertical mixed-use in key locations.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Development of neighborhood centers \(zoning\)**

Zoning codes should allow for appropriately-scaled commercial development in targeted neighborhood centers close within existing housing neighborhoods.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Allow desirable uses by-right \(zoning\)** 

Zoning codes determine what “uses” are allowed on a site. Codes generally divide “uses” into four categories: allowed by- right, allowed by site plan review, subject to discretionary review by special permit, or not allowed. Applicants prefer uses allowed “by-right” because they involve minimal permitting time, fees, and ****complication. Most important, an applicant is ensured that they will receive a permit as long as they follow the requirements spelled out in the zoning. Allowing a use by-right creates an incentive for that use, while requiring site plan review or special permit review can create a disincentive \(sometimes warranted, sometimes not\). Communities need to carefully think through which uses they desire in which districts, which uses really require additional review or discretion, and make permitting pathways as predictable and easy as possible for all uses. See the chapter, “Site Plan and Special Permit Review” for more on these reviews and how they can benefit communities\). Whenever possible, communities should avoid unnecessary special permits. Communities should allow uses by-right if they are desirable and in character with the district. For example, senior centers and lifestyle centers, health care facilities, pharmacies, cafes and restaurants, community gardens, food stores, famers markets and other uses that are important to older adults should be allowed by-right in appropriate districts \(especially within walking distance of population centers\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Encourage park-once designs for new commercial developments \(Site Plan and Special Permit Review\)**

Larger development projects should be encouraged to provide a variety of shapes and sizes of commercial spaces to facilitate co-location of a variety of community services and supports. And to design sites such that older adults can park once and walk from business to business.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Require site plan review for major destinations to ensure that sites meet the needs of older adults \(Site Plan Review\).**

To meet the needs of older drivers site plan review should encourage safe parking lots with obvious circulation patterns and directional arrows, require signage that has high contrast large type and is located appropriately, require adequate lighting while minimizing glare, and providing safe entrances and exits to roads. To meet the needs of all pedestrians, and especially of older adults, \(and drivers after they leave their cars\), site plan review should encourage pathways throughout sites that lead directly to destinations. Pathways should be protected from car traffic with highly visible and predictable crosswalks at road or driveway crossings. Pathways should have smooth, high-grip surfaces. Site plan review should encourage pedestrian facilities like benches, shelters, and interesting ground level features including plantings. Site plan review should require lighting that provides enough light while minimizing glare. Site plan review can encourage reasonable levels of accessibility when ADA standards do not apply. Site plan review can encourage dedicated parking for older adults near building entrances. Finally site plan review should require adequate shade to minimize local heat island effects.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Invest in retrofits for existing commercial areas to transform them into park-once areas \(Smart Growth Development\).**

Communities can make investments in public infrastructure to improve existing commercial areas so that they become pedestrian friendly environments. Areas where people can park-once and walk to multiple destinations in close proximity are particularly important to older adults. ****Possible investments include providing public parking \(especially on-street parking\), improving sidewalks, installing benches, street trees, and public restrooms.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Maintain existing pedestrian infrastructure \(Municipal process\)** Poorly maintained sidewalks are a hazard for all, and tripping and falling is a major concern for many older adults. These ****hazards can severely limit an older person’s willingness to get out and walk. Cities should allocate regular funding for sidewalk repair and replacement to deal with cracks that inevitably arise from frost and tree roots. In addition, cities can enact and enforce snow removal ordinances and/or take on responsibility for removing snow from sidewalks. Enacting a Downtown Business Improvement Districts \(BIDs\) can be an effective way to fund maintenance of pedestrian infrastructure in key locations.
