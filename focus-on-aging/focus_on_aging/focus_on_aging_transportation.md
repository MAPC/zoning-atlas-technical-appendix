# Transportation

Being able to go where one wants, using a means of transportation that one chooses is important for everyone and is a fundamental part of healthy aging. Transportation links us to essential goods and services, connects us with friends, family and activities, and provides an element of self-reliance that is important to older adults’ emotional and physical well- being.

In Massachusetts, as in the rest of the nation, transportation options for many people are extremely limited. The personal car is by far the most dominant form of transportation accounting for 68.5% of trips in the state.62 What this statistic doesn’t communicate, however, is that for many older adults, there is functionally only one transportation option available. If a person lives in an area with no public transportation where travel distances exceed one’s ability to walk, driving a car is the only option.

Likewise, for the significant number of older adults who are not licensed to drive \(12% of people 65-69 and increasing to 52% of people 85 and over\)63 or do not have access to a car \(7% of people 60-69 increasing to 17.6% of people 80 and over\),64 there is often only one transportation option remaining. Depending on personal abilities and community setting, it may be only walking \(including using a wheelchair, cane or walker\), only using public transportation or only relying on others with cars. The lack of redundant transportation options leaves older adults vulnerable to isolation. Losing a driver’s license or spraining an ankle can leave a formerly active older person essentially housebound. As we have seen in our explorations of housing and destinations, increasing diversity in our community’s transportation systems will facilitate healthy aging. It is important to note that Council on Aging and Senior Centers have worked to address this issue creating volunteer ride services to assist older adults who do not drive.

There are several myths about older adults and transportation that need to be debunked. The first is that older adults stop driving and switch to walking, and then switch from walking to public transportation. This is not true. Older adults usually continue to drive longer than they continue to walk and transit usage by older adults is low and is dropping. It fell by 50% between 1995 and 2000 to 1.3% of all trips.65 Not only do older adults continue to drive, but overall they are driving more than they used to. Vehicle miles traveled increased for people 65+ between 2001 and 2009, whereas it fell for all other age groups.66 This may reflect older adults living increasingly active lives, it may reflect older adults continuing to work and commute into later ages, or it may reflect the “graying of suburbia”—older adults are disproportionately represented in the populations of outer ring suburbia where the land use pattern can require more driving. The evidence seems to show that for older adults, driving is a key way of getting out in the world. Older drivers take six trips a week outside of their homes, while non-drivers average only two trips.67 This reduction may have significant impacts on social connections.

Another myth is that older adults are bad drivers. Older adults have fewer crashes per capita than do other age groups. They are more law-abiding and take fewer risks. However, older adults are more likely to be significantly injured or killed than younger people when they are involved in traffic accidents. They also experience more crashes per trip or vehicle mile traveled than other ages of drivers.

As dangerous as driving is for older adults, walking may be more so. Older adults are more likely to be hit by cars, and more likely to die when they are hit. “People 70 and over, who constitute less than 10% of the population, account for 18 percent of pedestrian deaths.”68 What’s more, falls are a leading cause of death from injuries to older adults. Streets and sidewalks which present uneven surfaces, slick spots, grade changes, and tripping hazards can be particularly hazardous. It is possible that street falls may be a more significant health risk than auto-pedestrian crashes.69 “Overall, the elderly may be fifteen times more likely to be injured or killed as pedestrians than as drivers.”70

Older adults face a complex situation when they evaluate which transportation option to use. Walking can help maintain overall health, but it can also lead to catastrophic injury or death. Driving is convenient, often the only option, and can also result in serious injury or death. Biking and public transportation also have their pros and cons. This is not an enviable situation and we should be able to design our transportation system better than this.

As discussed in the various “Leverage Points” sections of this toolkit, our transportation system includes publicly and privately owned components. Changing the transportation system involves intervening in community plans and policies, local regulations, and by local, state, and federal transportation infrastructure investments. On the local level, community plans and policies can set a basic framework for prioritizing infrastructure improvements. Zoning sets the basic land use pattern. It determines densities and distances between destinations and therefore has a fundamental influence on the type of transportation required to get from A to B. If a community’s zoning code does not allow densities that are support public transportation, there will be no

public transportation. If a community’s zoning code establishes commercial districts that are far from housing, then auto dependence will increase. Zoning also influences site level design through Site Plan Review and Special Permits. In this capacity zoning can influence how people enter, exit, move through, and move past a site. Site Plan Review and Special Permits have historically placed a strong emphasis on the traffic impacts of development. They are increasingly contemplating pedestrian and bicycle usage and can result in major improvements in this realm by requiring adequate sidewalks, limiting curb cuts, requiring street trees, requiring bike racks, requiring benches, etc.

Subdivision Regulations are another local regulation that influences the transportation system. In developments where land is subdivided and new roads and sidewalks are built, it is Subdivision Regulations that control their fundamental design characteristics. Subdivision Regulations can control road features like lane width, paving materials, allowed grades, sharpness of curves, and curb radii. They can also set design criteria for sidewalks, open spaces, and other pedestrian and bike necessities.

In most places in Massachusetts, the existing road, and sidewalk network is largely established and is under the control of a mix of private owners, organizations, local, state and federal governments. Improving existing transportation infrastructure requires well-organized advocacy for change, demonstrating need through rigorous transportation studies, and obtaining funding—which can be a significant obstacle. That said, all roads and sidewalks need periodic maintenance which can provide an opportunity for minor improvements or major overhauls.

Each means of moving through our communities—driving, walking, biking, and public transportation—requires community design improvements to help everyone get around and keep active, and the improvements are particularly important for older adults. We will discuss each means of transportation separately below.

**Driving and Healthy Aging**

As discussed elsewhere, older adults have a variety of characteristics that can influence how they drive. Years of driving experience, risk aversion, and adherence to laws can lead to safe driving habits. Changes in vision, hearing, neck mobility, and reaction time, can place older drivers at risk in certain situations. In response to limitations, older adults tend to adjust their driving behavior. Not only do they reduce their number of trips and the length of those trips, but they often plan routes to avoid fast streets, difficult intersections or other perceived dangers. Ultimately, these coping strategies reduce the number of accidents experienced by older adults, but they can result in isolation, increase gas consumption and emissions, and contribute to congestion on local routes. In places with poorly connected road networks, a single barrier \(like a fast-moving road or a particularly dangerous intersection\) can dramatically reduce an older person’s ability to get to destinations. A small number of improvements to our transportation system will benefit everyone and are particularly important to older adults.

## **Key Leverage Points for Driving**

**Provide diverse road types and speeds \(zoning, Subdivision Regulations, Municipal Policies\)** Everyone is well served when they can choose to travel on the type of road that suits them best. Roads should have diverse widths, diverse travel speeds, and diverse intersection designs. Form- based codes \(a type of zoning\) can set requirements that guide the build-out of road networks and the rebuilding of existing roads. Typically the code shows desired street types through typical road cross-sections \(a drawing that illustrates the width and arrangement of car and bike lanes, sidewalk widths and characteristics, street trees, medians, etc.\). Form-based codes link these street types to specific locations on a map. This indicates clearly to developers and public works departments what kind of road is desired in which location. How well local public works adhere to this guidance is largely a matter of local policy and executive leadership. Subdivision regulations can also establish desired road cross-sections that apply to new developments.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Require a well-connected road and pedestrian network \(Subdivision Regulations and zoning\)**

In order to have a choice of roads, there must be a well connected road network with multiple ****pathways between destinations. Ellen Dunham-Jones recommends that communities “establish a connectivity index based on minimum intersection density for new development as a means to improve street network efficiency.”71 This can be included in subdivision standards and is primarily applicable to communities where large subdivisions are being built. For all sizes of developments, communities can require new subdivision roads and sidewalks to connect to roads and sidewalks on neighboring parcels, or set aside a right of way for future connections. Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, a leading designer, recommends the following metrics for connectivity which can be requited through subdivision standards: intersection spacing is frequent, with no more than 200-500 feet between intersections. Walking distance for the perimeter of a block is no more than a quarter mile or 1,320 feet. The number of street intersections per square mile is generous, ranging from 120 to 240. The ratio of four-way intersections to three way intersections is telling: four-way intersections provide more connection than three-way intersections.72 Four-way intersections also happen to be generally safer for older adults. Form-based zoning can also help create a well-connected road and sidewalk network through the establishment of a regulating plan with designated street locations and types.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Install highly visible signs \(zoning, Subdivision Regulations, and Road Design\)**

Signs are regulated by zoning on the site level, Subdivision Regulations for street signs in new developments, and are part of Road Design for municipal, and state roads. In all of these situations, signs are more useful if they are reflective, and have high contrast, large type. For older adults the location of signs is important—when possible, they should be placed over the center of the road and well in advance of the destination to allow time to react and respond. Signs can also add to visual clutter and distract drivers. Zoning is the main tool for limiting overly distracting signs.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Establish dedicated left-turn lanes at busy intersections \(Road Design\)**

Left turns at busy intersections can be particularly difficult for some older drivers who experience slower reaction times and difficulty turning their neck. To compensate, some older drivers attempt to navigate to their destination by only making right-hand turns. To help them out, communities can consider adding dedicated left-turn lanes with a signal arrow at busy intersections. Beginning the lane at mid-block allows time for an older driver to enter the lane.`73` Note that adding dedicated left-turn lanes conflicts with the need to narrow intersections to reduce crossing times and improve walkability.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Use medians on wide streets and streets with a lot of traffic \(Road Design\)**

Medians have multiple benefits. They can reduce glare from on-coming traffic. They can provide a protected space for pedestrians and bicyclists to stop and rest when crossing wide streets. When planted with trees they can provide shade and beautify the street. Medians can slow traffic by decreasing real and/or perceived road width \(people drive faster on wider roads\). Medians can also restrict left-hand turns to intersections increasing predictability for drivers travelling the opposite direction.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Enhance pavement markings \(Road Design\)**

Retro-reflective pavement markings, wider lane stripes \(6-8” instead of the typical 4”\), and curbs treated with retroreflective paint and/or reflectors can help older drivers stay on course, particularly at night and in wet conditions.74

**Convert two-way stop intersections to four-way stop intersections \(Road Design\)**

**Walking and Healthy Aging**

Walking and/or using a wheelchair for daily activities is a valuable way to get recommended daily exercise. Walking has numerous health benefits including, improving blood pressure, reducing risk of heart disease, alleviating depression, and significantly reducing the risk of

Alzheimer’s.75 Despite the numerous benefits, older Americans make less than 9% of their trips by walking.76 This is in part due to the built environment—most communities are simple not set up for pedestrians. Both the general land use pattern of a community and the specific infrastructure for pedestrians can influence how much people walk. A study that compared older non-drivers who lived in

In his late 80’s, Gene walks two and a half hours a day. He typically visits a local café for a healthy bowl of vegeterian soup and the library which is “his second home.” He walks on the street rather than along the sidewalk because he thinks the danger of being hit by a car is lower than the danger of tripping and falling on the cracked, uneven sidewalks. For those who don’t get out and move, he says, “Just get started. I started running marathons in my 50’s and ran six of them because I wanted to set an example for my daughters.“ ****high-density, walkable neighborhoods in the Philadelphia metro area with their counterparts in sprawling the Los Angeles metro area, found that in walkable Philadelphia, only 35% of older non-drivers stay home on a given day. In L.A., that number jumps to 53%. When considering pedestrian infrastructure, the barriers are obvious and fundamental. In a recent poll, “40 percent of adults age 50 and older reported inadequate sidewalks in their neighborhood. Nearly 50 percent reported that they cannot cross main roads close to their homes safely. Half of those who reported such problems said they would walk, bicycle, or take the bus more if problems

were fixed.” `77` There are a lot of problems to fix, and there is some evidence that a substantial number of them must be completed before older adults will shift to walking more. A study of older Atlantans, found that only those who lived neighborhoods which were in the top third of walkability were more likely to walk than those in the least walkable neighborhoods. In other words, older adults require very high levels of walkability before their behavior changes.

However, on the positive side, the study’s authors concluded that “walking levels could increase 2-fold if older adults had access to multiple destinations within short distances by living in a more walkable neighborhood as currently defined.”`78` There is much to do, but the potential rewards of improving walkability are great.

## **Key Leverage Points for Walking**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Encourage compact development patterns where housing is located close to destinations \(zoning\)**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Set appropriate pedestrian crossing signal times \(Road Design\)**

Pedestrian crossing signals should be set for a walking speed of 3.5 feet per second plus 7 seconds to leave the curb.79 \(This signal length may still not accommodate all users, including those in wheelchairs\). Note, however, that if pedestrian signal times are too long, drivers may become impatient and engage in risky behavior like running a red light to avoid waiting at a long light, or making an illegal right turn on red. Because of this conflict, the best approach is to reduce the curb-to-curb length of pedestrian crossings whenever possible.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Limit right turn on red \(Road Design\)**

Right turns on red are a major source of auto-pedestrian fatalities for older adults and can result in death at even relatively low speeds. Channelized right turn lanes enable drivers to move ****through an intersection faster, and therefore increase the likelihood of death if they hit an older pedestrian. There is a 5% chance that a pedestrian will die if hit by a motor vehicle at 20 mph. That chance increases to 45% at 30 mph and 85% at 40 mph.80
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Build adequate sidewalks \(Site Plan Review and Subdivision Regulations, Road Design\)** 

Sidewalks should have a minimum 4-6’ pedestrian clearway. A pedestrian clearway is the area of a sidewalk in which a person is free to move without obstacles like signs, parking meters, benches, or café tables. Sidewalks should have smooth non-slip pavements. Sidewalks should have minimal cross-slope. Curb ramps should lead directly to sidewalks. Two curb ramps should be provided when there are two sidewalks, rather than one in the middle of the two sidewalks.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Limit corner radii \(Site Plan Review and Subdivision Regulations, Road Design\)**

A corner radius is the curved sections of a curb at the intersection of two streets, or a street and a driveway. Corner radii allow vehicles to make turns without the backwheels hitting the curb. The larger the curb radius, the faster a given vehicle can make a turn. Historically, communities have required large curb radii so that the largest vehicles could make turns without obstacles.

However, large curb radii have a significant impact on pedestrians. Larger curb radii result in longer distances from curb to curb for pedestrians, and for pedestrians, the length of a road crossing is directly related to the length of time they are at risk of being hit by a car. Corner radii, in normal situations, should not be larger than 10-15 feet. Some urban areas make them as small as 2 feet.81
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Provide complete pedestrian infrastructure \(Site Plan Review and Subdivision Regulations, Road Design\)**

For high levels of walkability, pedestrians require more than just sidewalks. They require shade which can be provided by street trees. They require places to rest which can be provided by benches or café tables. They require public bathrooms. All of these elements are particularly important to older adults who tend to be more sensitive to heat, need to rest more often, and require bathroom breaks for frequently. These elements of pedestrian infrastructure for older adults should be seen as necessities--not amenities–for everyone .

**Case Study: NYC Safe Streets for Seniors Initiative**

“Through its Safe Streets for Seniors initiative the City’s \[NYC\] Department of Transportation \(DOT\) is implementing safety improvements in 25 areas identified as having an above-average rate of senior pedestrian fatalities and injuries. Typical improvements include: extending pedestrian crossing times at crosswalks, adding countdown clocks, altering curbs and sidewalks, restricting vehicle turns, and narrowing roadways. As of May 2013, DOT had finished implementing improvements in 17 of the 25 areas. Since Safe Streets for Seniors began, senior pedestrian fatalities have decreased 21% citywide from 58 in 2008 to 46 in 2012 and safety for all road users, especially pedestrians, continues to improve where these projects have been implemented.”

**Biking and Healthy Aging**

Like walking, biking has numerous health benefits, as well as risks for older adults. Generally, biking is limited to older adults with few physical limitations. However, bicycle technology is rapidly expanding access to older adults with physical limitations, especially through three and four wheeled bicycles. Biking allows older adults to travel longer distances and is therefore important for carrying out daily tasks in areas where the distance between home and destinations are larger than about a ¼ mile.

**Key Leverage Points for Biking**

Our research did not identify any special needs for older bicyclists. For key leverage points for all ages see “Walking, Biking and Transit Networks.”

**Public Transportation and Healthy Aging** Though older adults make relatively few trips via public transportation, for those who depend on it is a crucial link. While people of all ages want more frequent, faster public transportation with routes that go to desirable destinations, older adults also make some more humble requests as detailed below.

**Key Leverage Points for Public**

**Transportation**

**Create legible route maps and time tables \(Walking, Biking and Transit Networks\)**

Older adults who use public transportation find that the route maps and the time tables they use to navigate the system are difficult to read. Large, high contrast type and graphics would help everyone, especially older adults, take advantage of existing public transportation.

**Courteous Drivers \(Walking, Biking and Transit Networks\)**

Older adults deserve respect. They ask that public transportation employees act more courteously.

**Eliminate restrictions on what can be transported by public transportation \(Walking, Biking and Transit Networks\)**

Some public transportation systems limit the number of grocery bags that a person can carry onto a bus. Others limit when a bike can be moved by public transportation. This kind of limitation which is intended to reduce congestion on vehicles, also limits older adults’s ability to use public transportation for daily activities.

**Reserve Seats for Older adults \(Walking, Biking and Transit Networks\)**

**Provide Shelters and benches at bus stops \(Walking, Biking and Transit Networks\) Provide public restrooms near bus stops \(Walking, Biking and Transit Networks\)**
