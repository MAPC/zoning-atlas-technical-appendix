# Housing for Healthy Aging

Just as is there is no one way that people age, the housing needs of older adults are diverse. Older adults choose to live in housing of all shapes and sizes and levels of quality: single-family homes, two-family homes, apartments, congregate housing. They live in traditional neighborhoods, condos, retirement communities, nursing homes, gated communities and subsidized housing. They in a wide range of communities: 26% of Americans over 50 live in small towns, 23% live in suburbs, 19% live out in the country, 19% live in urban areas, and 12% live in rural villages.`34`

The housing needs of older adults are characterized by two opposing trends. Older adults express an overwhelming preference for aging-in-place, preferring to stay in their homes or community, and that preference grows stronger as they grow older.`35` Older adults are less likely to move than other age groups, and when they do move most stay in the same county.`36` On the other hand, people’s housing needs often change as they age—driven primarily by economic, physical, and family and lifestyle changes. While the stereotype is that older adults have declining incomes and shrinking families and therefore downsize to smaller units, the changes associated with aging can have actually have unpredictable results. A more well-off older person may have the resources to downsize to a more desirable smaller unit, while sometimes lower-income older adults choose to stay in their existing housing—either because they cannot afford to re-enter the housing market, or because their grown children and their families continue to live with them. Likewise, regarding physical changes associated with aging, the stereotypes do not always hold. Some older adults want to change housing because of physical impairments. Doorways or hallways may not be wide enough to accommodate mobility devices. Their home may lack an accessible bathroom, or have a front door that requires too many steps. It is important to note that while home modification programs exist, many older adults are not aware of them, or cannot access them effectively.`37` In Massachusetts Aging Services Access Points \(ASAPs\) in communities, as well as Councils on Aging and Senior Centers are useful resources for learning about such programs.

In contract to older adults who find their homes need modification as they age, some older adults find that their house is not physically challenging enough. It may be located where one cannot walk to goods and services, or it may not provide access to active recreation opportunities like golf, a swimming pool, or walking trails. Family and lifestyle changes can also render an older person’s home not a good fit anymore. A rural house that suited an aging couple just fine for 50 years may become a scene of isolation when one spouse dies. A retiree who settled close to the freeway for a shorter commute may choose to relocate closer to the center of town so she can be closer to volunteer and social opportunities. Or a married couple may have one member who needs to move to a care facility and their spouse may choose to move near the care facility to facilitate more frequent visits.

Though older adults want and need to live in a wide variety of circumstances, it is generally acknowledged that in many communities the existing housing stock is not diverse enough to meet their needs. The inherent conflict between the desire to stay in a familiar home and community, and the need to change can be very stressful for older adults. The stress is exacerbated when the housing stock in a person’s community does not meet their needs: either because housing with desirable features is unavailable or unaffordable. In 2012, 40% of older households \(65+\) had significant housing challenges.`38` We do our older adults a disservice by not designing communities with diverse housing options that can enable them to remain within their community of choice throughout the continuum of life. Instead, we should be striving for the ultimate goal of aging in place “achieving true choice in housing—the ability to live wherever we want, regardless of age or ability`39`”

So what steps can you take to steer your community toward housing that better meets the needs of older adults? The first step is for a community to inventory its existing housing and the housing needs of its population \(including older adults\). You can find more information about conducting a housing needs assessment at:[**http://www.housingpolicy.org//toolbox/strategy/policies/housing\_needs\_MA.html.** ](http://www.housingpolicy.org//toolbox/strategy/policies/housing_needs_MA.html.%20)\*\*\*\*

At the same time as one assesses housing needs, it is useful to take a close look at the physical layout of your community. Knowing the broad land use pattern of your community \(is it a small town? Is it rural? Is it urban?\), can help one understand what kinds of interventions in the built environment to prioritize. For example, in an urban place, identifying naturally occurring retirement communities \(NORCs\) and improving services to them may be the first step. In a small town, facilitating the development of diverse housing types within walking distance of essential goods and services might be important. In a rural village, the important step might be to allow accessory apartments to help older adults afford to remain in their homes, or to enable them to build accessible second units while renting out the “main house.” In rural areas, innovative forms of housing development, like cohousing or cottage housing, can foster a sense of community for older adults, while minimizing development impacts on farmland and forestland.

Once a community has a broad understanding of what kind of housing it needs, and how it can fit into the existing land use pattern, it is time to explore whether the community’s existing regulations, policies and programs are helping or hindering development of desirable housing.

## **Key Leverage Points**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Provisions about mixed-use development \(zoning\)**

One of the defining features of community design since the 1950’s has been separation of different kinds of land uses into different parts of a community—housing goes in one part of the community, commercial uses go in a central business district or along main road, industrial uses go in the industrial park, etc. This separation of uses is required by many zoning codes in Massachusetts. It has resulted in a fragmented landscape in which housing is far from the jobs, stores, and health clinics that residents frequent. The separation of uses goes hand-in-hand with auto-dependence, because the distance between home and destination often is simply too far to walk, bike, or travel in a wheelchair conveniently. In addition the separation of uses has often been accompanied by road planning that prioritizes maximal speed and convenience for cars to the detriment of pedestrians and bicyclists`40`. For example, commercial strips may not have sidewalks or crosswalks, or may have excessively long blocks. For seniors, whose travel radius often shrinks and for whom driving can become more difficult, the separation of uses and associated transportation system can be particularly challenging. It can make it difficult to carry out daily activities like shopping, or visiting the doctor. In addition, the separation of uses makes caring for older adults in their homes more challenging: care givers spend more time driving and less time caring. Zoning codes can be revised to encourage mixed-use development. This is one of the crucial steps for redesigning communities in which older adults \(and everyone else\) can make the healthy choice to bike, walk \(with or without a walker or cane\), use a wheelchair or use another mobility assistive device to get to basic goods and services. `41`

**Provisions about house-sharing \(zoning\)**

Some older adults want to share housing with unrelated adults, but find that their local zoning prevents it. An older person may want to: rent out rooms in their house to get some extra income; barter housing for help with daily chores, or just share daily life with others. Local zoning codes sometimes restrict house-sharing. This is often accomplished by limiting housing units to one family per unit and then defining a “family” as not more than a certain number of unrelated adults. Contact your local planning department, planning board, or zoning enforcement officer to see if your community’s zoning restricts house sharing.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Provisions about housing other than single-family \(zoning\)**

Single-family houses are generally the most expensive form of housing, require the most maintenance, have the highest utility expenses, and can be the most isolating. Recognizing this, some older adults want to move into an apartment in their home community, but many find that there are no apartments available. This can be the result of market forces, but it is also often the result of local zoning. Many zoning codes significantly limit—or even outlaw—housing other than single-family houses. A community’s zoning code may simply not allow two-family, three-family, or multi-family housing. This has disproportionate effects on older adults since 25% of those over age 55 live in multifamily housing, occupying 60% of all multifamily housing.`42` It may limit these unit-types to locations that are not desirable or economically feasible. Zoning codes sometimes steer development toward single-family housing in more subtle ways, including requiring large lots, having excessive parking requirements, limiting allowed building heights, or preventing the development of more than unit per lot \(which restricts condo development\). Zoning barriers to two-family, three-family and multi-family housing can severely limit the housing options available to older adults and can force older adults into choosing between staying in unsuitable housing so that they can maintain their social network and life patterns, or moving elsewhere and sacrificing social connections for housing that meets their size or cost needs. Review your community’s zoning code to see where your community allows housing other than single-family dwellings, and to understand where you can make the most efficient and effective changes to accommodate older adults who desire to stay in their homes. Usually this information can be found in the “table of uses” or “permitted uses table.”

{% hint style="info" %}
**Provisions about accessory dwelling units \(zoning\)**

Accessory dwelling units, sometimes called in-law apartments or granny-flats, are secondary dwelling units that are added to an existing house. The accessory dwelling unit may be in a converted garage, or in an underutilized wing of a house. Accessory dwelling units can be used in several ways to provide better housing options for older adults. Adult children may develop an accessory dwelling unit to house their parents. Or an older person may develop an accessory dwelling unit to rent out for extra income. Sometimes an older person builds the accessory unit for himself or his spouse. Many zoning codes do not allow accessory dwelling units. Others limit where they can be built by requiring excessive large lot sizes or setbacks that do not fit the historical pattern of development in a community, or by preventing the conversion of existing non-conforming structures into accessory dwelling units \(many garages and carriage houses in older communities predate zoning codes and are therefore closer to lot lines than current zoning allows\). When implemented effectively, bylaws allowing accessory dwelling unit can have a significant effect. Santa Cruz, California has one of the nation’s most developed accessory dwelling unit programs. It results in the creation of 40-50 ADUs.`43`

{% hint style="info" %}
**Provisions about innovative housing types \(zoning and subdivision regulations\)**

There are several unusual forms of housing development that are particularly suited to older adults. **Cohousing** is a method of development in which a group of people gets together to act as the developer for a housing community. Typically, cohousing groups attempt to reduce the cost of new house construction by eliminating the usual developer’s profit margin, building units that are smaller than typical for their market. Smaller units are often achieved by sharing certain spaces amongst all housing units. For example, there may be a shared guestroom in the cohousing development, rather than each unit having its own guestroom. Cohousing often has a common green space, a common house, and keeps cars on the outside of the development with pedestrian only paths on the interior. All of these design features, create a sociable and safe environment for people of all ages. Furthermore, because a cohousing community’s development and management is done by the residents, cohousing communities often develop a unique culture and sense of community that residents say enrich their lives. The social aspect of cohousing is particularly beneficial for older adults and elder cohousing developments are a growing trend with documented positive emotional impacts for older adults. Communities can ****promote cohousing by allowing “flexible development,” sometimes known as cluster development, open space residential development, or natural resource protection zoning.`44` In addition, they can add cohousing as an allowed use in their zoning regulations, including explicitly allowing common buildings for residential use including shared home office and workshop space. Finally, communities can review their subdivision regulations to ensure that they do not erect roadblocks to the compact development patterns typically associated with cohousing.

Cottage housing is another innovative form of housing development that is particularly suited to older adults. A cottage housing development, sometimes called a pocket neighborhood, typically takes an in-town lot that would normally be developed for a limited number of large single family houses, and instead develops a larger number of small cottage units \(under 1000 sq ft\) around a shared green. Cottage housing is like cohousing, except that it is usually not initiated and developed by the future occupants. Also, the size of the housing units and the total developed parcel are typically smaller. Cottage housing is often targeted at a lower cost than typical single family housing development in the same area. Local zoning and subdivision regulations can be modified to encourage cottage housing. One way to facilitate cottage housing is for zoning to allow “multiple units per lot” in certain districts. This enables an applicant to avoid a costly subdivision permitting process and thereby promotes cohousing, cottage housing, and condos of all styles. If a community wants to target cottage housing while prohibiting other similar forms of development, they can establish a use category in zoning for cottage housing with an associated definition that distinguishes cottage housing from other forms of development \(likely establishing benchmarks for parcel size, unit size, minimum and maximum densities, and provision of shared outdoor space\). Cottage housing can be allowed “by-right”, but because cottage housing is typically located in existing neighborhoods but is intentionally different from the existing pattern of development, communities often require some level of review to ensure the cottage housing “fits in.” The local zoning may specify that cottage housing requires “site plan review” a process through which a reviewing board evaluates a proposed development’s lot layout \(site plan\) and can ask for modifications to the plan to ensure that the development meets the community’s goals. Or a community may require a “special permit” for cottage housing. Special permits are discretionary zoning permits which are more involved and costly for developers—especially since they carry the possibility that the application may be denied. In addition, zoning dimensional requirements, and subdivision regulations standards can be modified to facilitate cottage housing.

**Provisions about senior housing \(zoning\)**

Though less than 5% of older adults live in “senior housing”`45` which includes continuing care communities, assisted living facilities, nursing homes, and other retirement communities, senior housing does meet important needs of diverse older populations. Zoning can, and often does, establish specialized use categories for various kind of senior housing. This enables communities to regulate where senior housing can go, and its basic lot characteristics. One of the challenges of senior housing is that it often requires large parcels which are often only available only in ****“greenfield” locations \(undeveloped farm and forest land\). Many communities want to preserve their existing undeveloped land. Furthermore, greenfield locations are often outside of existing neighborhoods and far from existing commercial center. Their location can force residents of the senior housing into a car dependent lifestyle and/or isolate them from the broader community. Communities can review site plan and subdivision regulations to ensure that senior housing will provide safe access and internal circulation for older adults and staff, and appropriate gathering spaces. Communities can proactively identify appropriate parcels for senior housing and work to steer development toward them. It is especially helpful if communities can advocate for planned development that includes not only senior housing, but housing for other age groups as well and commercial development.

**Provisions about Visitability \(zoning\)**

The Americans with Disabilities Act established standards for physical accessibility of buildings and spaces that must be met by most public and commercial entities \(especially new construction\). However, there is no similar requirement that covers private housing. Visitability is a relatively new movement that advocates for a small number of design modifications to all homes to enable a minimum level of access by almost all people. These modifications are:

* At least one zero-step entrance \(meaning the front door is level with the ground outside
* Doors and halls with at least 32 inches of clear passable width
* A ground floor half-bathroom that is accessible by wheel chair

Visitability can incentivized through local zoning provisions. For example, density bonuses can be provided under cluster development provisions, for developments that provide visitable housing.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Policies about Universal Design \(Municipal policies\)**

Municipal policies can require universal design for municipal facilities like schools, senior centers, town halls and public spaces. For more on universal design see the box in the “Green and Fit Buildings” Chapter.
