# Food Access

This edition of the Healthy Community Design Toolkit—Leveraging Positive Change adds a focus on municipal strategies to facilitate food access in Massachusetts. Food access is increasingly being understood as playing a key role in people's health and well-being, especially for economically disadvantaged and otherwise marginalized families and individuals. Since 1994 when the United States Department of Agriculture \(USDA\) worked with the Census Bureau to create measures of food security at the household level to gauge food accessibility, practitioners in both the public and private sectors from all levels of government including but not limited to planners, public health advocates, food banks, and community supported agriculture proponents have been working to improve health outcomes of economically disadvantaged people by improving food access.

#### Food access includes \(but is certainly not limited to\):

* healthy fresh food that is reasonably-priced for people of diverse economic backgrounds,
* access to full-line grocery stores, small stores, farm stands, farmers markets, mobile markets, food delivery services, and CSA farm shares—access being defined to include not only proximity, but also convenient transportation options for people of all ages and abilities, and consideration of economic and cultural factors that drive food purchasing choices,
* universal access by eligible individuals and families to food assistance available from all levels of government as well as from the private and not-for-profit sectors, and the ability to use that assistance at all healthy food retail outlets including farmers markets,`[1]`
* the possibility to grow one’s own food, including cultivating vegetables, fruits, berries, raising chickens and other small livestock,
* farmers’ ability to make a decent living—to sell their products at a variety of outlets without undue regulatory burden, including farm stands, on-farm retail, farmers markets, mobile markets, and through CSAs. This applies to both “traditional” farmers and urban farmers who may operate on small plots of land with a low volume of sales,
* Long-term preservation of high quality farmland and transformation of underutilized land in urban areas to productive use,
* the abilitiy of small food retailers to be able to make a reasonable profit selling reasonably priced healthy fresh food—which implies new approaches to distribution models, access to affordable refrigeration and support and technical assistance to operators of these stores so they can run their businesses sustainably,
* limiting access to, and promotion of, unhealthy food to decrease its competitive advantage based on cost, and/or convenience ,
* assessing, and correcting as necessary, municipal plans, policies, regulations, programs, and systems to ensure that they facilitate—and certainly do not hinder—individuals’, families’, neighborhood’s, and communities’ ability to access healthy food

 “Healthy food access is about improving economic and community health. It is about investing in the people and places that have been left behind. It is about providing access to community services and creating economic opportunity. Above all, it is about better health.”

—PolicyLink & The Food Trust, Access to Healthy Food and Why It Matters \(2013\)
{% endhint %}

In 2013 PolicyLink published an excellent Report, Access to Healthy Food and Why It Matters: A Review of the Research, that documents the sad reality that "low-income communities and communities of color have less access to healthy food than higher-income and less diverse communities."`[2]`The PolicyLink report also documents the inter-connectedness of food access and transportation access, citing numerous studies that scientifically support the statement that, "Lack of transportation is... a barrier to accessing a full-service supermarket or grocery store."`[3]` The majority of research studies examined support the association between healthy eating and positive health outcomes with access to healthy food. That is, research supports the utility of strategies such as placing full-line grocery stores in poor neighborhoods that lack grocery stores and improving corner stores/bodegas by adding refrigeration capacity and putting healthy food on display as customers walk in versus candy and 'junk food.’ There is a small sub-set of research that questions the connection between these kinds of interventions and improvements in health outcomes of individuals, but deeper review of these studies reveals more the complexity of establishing correlations and the challenge of using uniform definitions than it does de-legitimize the need for these strategies.

#### Key findings from both the scientific literature and the work of practitioners in the field of improving food access are:

* The emphasis on households and individuals who lack access to a car—study after study suggests that households with cars are much more able to adapt to the challenges of limited food access than households without access to a car.
* The importance of the built environment—especially for households without access to a car! If there are full-line grocery stores and corner stores in walkable neighborhoods, then households without access to a car are still able to access healthy food.
* The emphasis on cost of healthy food and the need to supplement poor people's incomes to enable them to access healthy food.
* The power of advertising and the emphasis in stores that cater to poor people on junk food versus healthy food, with the reverse true in stores that cater to wealthy people.`[4]`
* The complexity of food shopping choices that include not only geographical location of retail food outlets, but also social and cultural factors. `[5]`

A very important finding is that “strong and consistent” scientific evidence supports SNAP, WIC and other safety net initiatives because they “can improve children’s health and education outcomes and help them achieve higher earnings in adulthood”.`[6]` Assuring that all eligible consumers use 100% of their benefits should be a top priority for all organizations and individuals working to improve their local food system.`[7]`

In addition, our research shows that strategies that improve access to healthy food often have numerous co-benefits, in particular environmental benefits, economic benefits, and increased social cohesion. Co-benefits were especially prominent in the literature related to urban agriculture.`[8]` For example: The interactions in urban gardens and farms often involve decision-making and planning processes that require consensus, making community gardens important places for encouraging democratic values and citizen engagement. For urban farms and businesses, the development of self-determination, self-reliance and activism are major impacts. Studies find that participants expressed improved self-esteem and pride.`[9]`

> “Fruits/vegetables dominated the view from the main entrance in 14% of low-price and 71% of high-price stores. By contrast, junk foods dominated the view from the main entrance in 67% of low-price stores and 33% of high price stores. On average, low price stores had 7.7 displays to promote healthy foods while high-price stores had 20.2 displays of healthy foods”--Ghosh-Dastidar et al.

#### Additional highlights from our research review affirm and clarify what most practitioners in the field have learned by doing:

* Design programs with community including integrating individual and family definitions of ‘proximity to healthy food’, and assuring use of \(and/or modifying as necessary\) government \(or other funder\) criteria for food deserts to assure maximum eligibility for funding/resources/technical assistance etc.
* Think \(and work\) comprehensively to understand and address the food insecurity causes and consequences in your specific community and tailor interventions to your population, with resident guidance and active participation—forming a food policy council with resident involvement is an effective way to ensure a long-term community-wide commitment to improving food access.
* Simply making healthy food available may not be adequate to change consumption patterns for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to: lack of awareness, cost, and the difficulty of changing patterns of behavior. It may be necessary to enhance placement of healthy food with public information and education efforts, including culturally appropriate recipes, cooking demonstrations, community-generated cookbooks, and other community events to introduce and reinforce healthy eating behaviors.
* Municipalities have a very important role to play in facilitating food access at the local level, as part of a Food Policy Council \(listed above\) but also performing technical and supportive roles for residents, such as pre-identifying lots appropriate for community gardens, and assuring access to water.`[10]`,`[11]`
* The evidence-base for most municipal strategies to facilitate food access is insufficient to establish causality. However, this should not be used as an excuse to not take action on strategies that appear to have some support. This is especially true because many community-based food access interventions have numerous co-benefits:
  * … examples abound describing how a new grocery store serves as the lifeblood for a struggling rural town, or offers a fresh start in employment for a previously incarcerated person; how a farmer’s market is fostering social cohesion in a neighborhood where racial tensions used to prevail; or how a new full-scale grocery store is bringing new economic vitality to a low-income, urban community of color that had lacked access for decades.`[12]`

{% tab title="Using this Resource" %}
Municipal Strategies to Increase Food Access presents a range of approaches municipal staff and board members, Mass in Motion Coordinators, and community food advocates can utilize to improve food access in their towns and cities. Strategies that affect change in municipal systems are presented first, followed by food production and food retail strategies. Each section describes the strategy and the change sought through its implementation; presents the motivations for and challenges in pursuing them; and offers guidance for how municipalities might implement strategies. Case studies describe how strategies have been implemented; Massachusetts examples are highlighted where they exist to give the reader a sense of what is accomplishable in the context of Massachusetts state and local governments. Additional resources are linked or included in the appendix, and these include guidance documents and in some cases, model language for ordinances and bylaws. 

~~**Each of the strategy sections includes a four-part table meant for quickly learning more about the strategy.**~~

{% hint style="warning" %}
In the table, “Strength of Evidence” refers to the degree to which strategies increase food access and improve related health outcomes. These evidence ratings come primarily from the County Health Rankings’ What Works For Health website, which is available at: [http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/roadmaps/what-works-for-health](http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/roadmaps/what-works-for-health). Where information is lacking, and where strategies have not been evaluated for their outcomes, this portion of the table is left blank. It should be noted that where tables are left blank, it does not suggest that the strategy does not improve food access or health outcomes, it means only that its outcomes have not been measured.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The table lists “Community Types,” developed by the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, that categorize the various types of towns and cities in Massachusetts. Municipal food access strategies may be relevant to some, but not all types of municipalities, and this section allows communities to identify strategies most relevant to their communities. Readers can find the MAPC Community Types typology in the Appendix or online at: [http://www.mapc.org/sites/default/files/Massachusetts\_Community\_Types\_-\_July\_2008.pdf](http://www.mapc.org/sites/default/files/Massachusetts_Community_Types_-_July_2008.pdf), and should identify which type\(s\) best describe their community. This can facilitate identifying relevant food access strategies more quickly.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
“Leverage Points” describe the municipal tools that can be used to implement strategies. These are described in greater detail in volume one of the Healthy Community Design Toolkit \([http://www.pvpc.org/projects/healthy-community-design-toolkit-leveraging-positive-change](http://www.pvpc.org/projects/healthy-community-design-toolkit-leveraging-positive-change)\), and include common municipal plans, regulations, policies, and programs. This section of the tables indicates where in municipal systems the strategy can be encoded and/or implemented.
{% endhint %}

All strategies seek to improve food access, either directly or through increasing the capacity of farmers or community member to grow food. The “Co-Benefits” describe the additional benefits that may result from implementing strategies, and include the following categories: Physical Health, Mental Health, Social Benefits, Environmental Sustainability, Safety and Injury Prevention, and Economic Benefits.  

Most strategies call for engaging diverse and representative groups from the community those that are affected by and those that are invested in food access issues – understanding that communities know what is best for them, and that systemic changes can be successful only with sustained engagement and action.  

This resources is intended to be used a reference, not read through from start to finish. Communities newly engaged in food access efforts may review the strategies as a part of exploring how to get started and identifying strategies appropriate to their circumstances. Where municipalities are already implementing strategies, the case studies, resource guides, and model language may be helpful in refining their approach. 

This document presents, to date, the most comprehensive range of strategies for Massachusetts cities and towns to consider in their efforts to improve food access. The field of food system planning still very young, and only in recent years have regions and states explicitly engaged in this field. As towns and cities increasingly engage in making their communities healthier through improving access to nutritious and affordable food, the range of strategies employed will grow. To get started, the following summary table lists all strategies indicating their relevant leverage points, evidence ratings, co-benefits, and community types. We recommend you this table to identify strategies worthy of further exploration in the remainder of the document.

`[5]` Broad Leib, Emily M. “All \(Food\) Politics is Local: Increasing Food Access through Local Government Action.” Harvard Law and Policy Review, 2013. A very useful summary article is offered by Leib et al. in their 2013 paper, “All \(Food\) Politics is Local: Increasing Food Access Through Local Government Action,” which not only does a nice job summarizing the state of the practice \(in 2012\), but also articulates a way of factoring in the human dimension to food choice. Historically, planners and public health workers have defined food access by geographic distance from food sources, resulting in a focus encouraging healthy food outlets to locate in underserved neighborhoods. Leib et al. introduce “social distance” into the traditionally geographically defined notion of “distance.” 

_Leib et al. explain social distance as integrating socio-demographic considerations and how people define their neighborhood, \(p. 326\) urging a “broader set of questions about the reasons for limited access or poor health outcomes.”`[5]` Tach and Amorim advance this idea in their study of 66 poor residents of three urban neighborhoods with limited food access.\[5\] They report, “We found that economic and geographic constraints strongly influenced where and how residents shopped, but within those constraints, residents developed a number of adaptive strategies to maximize the quality and variety of their groceries, even within the context of a food desert.” \[5\] Some of these adaptations include: shopping at multiple retailers to secure the lowest price, buying items on sale and/or in bulk, and buying store brands. Distance was only highlighted as a concern for people living in food deserts without access to a car. People living in food deserts without regular access to a car change their shopping habits. These people buy in bulk and buy less fresh food because they need it to last for several weeks.\[5\] Other research has shown “strategies that can impact nutritional status, such as meal skipping, food coupon use, and consumption of less expensive food items.”\[5\] Our research review revealed significant flaws in the way their relatively simple idea of geographic ‘distance’ has been defined. This has resulted in wildly different definitions of food deserts—definitions with far reaching impacts as they have been used to determine eligibility for federal and other government and privately funded food security initiatives. This small example shows how an overly simplistic understanding of human behavior can be encoded in governmental systems and end up having a profound impact on food access. It is a cautionary tale for use of the strategies contained in this report. We urge all practitioners to clearly define the population that is most in need, work closely with that population to identify their specific barriers to food access, and ensure that any municipal actions address those specific barriers._
