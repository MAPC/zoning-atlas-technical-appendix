# Community Gardening & Urban Agriculture

Community gardening and urban agriculture include small-scale crop cultivation and livestock raising in a variety of settings – from rural to urban. Community gardening takes place in shared plots or at schools, and supports growing food for personal consumption, educational purposes, and fosters community interactions. Urban agriculture typically describes commercial food production within more densely populated communities. Seeking to maximize efficient production in smaller spaces, urban farmers grow on ground-level farms, as well as vertical surfaces, rooftops, and even shipping containers; they employ techniques for growing intensively and in managed microclimates, mitigating soil contamination, and harvesting rainwater. \[1\] Urban agriculture is integrated in individual urban communities and neighborhoods as well as in the ways that cities function and are managed, including municipal policies, plans, and budgets.\[2\] In Massachusetts and across the country, support for community gardening and urban agriculture has steadily increased, evident in the growing network of community gardens, schoolyard gardening and culinary programs, innovative urban agriculture enterprises, and backyard gardens.

Those involved in community gardening and urban farming are realizing their community revitalization benefits of growing local food, building community relationships, spurring business and job development, and improving soil quality. Many efforts focus on low-income neighborhoods, and are explicit in improving the local food environment, increasing community quality of life, supporting entrepreneurship, bringing local job opportunities to those that face employment barriers.

Although urban farming has many benefits it also faces many challenges. In more densely populated areas land is scarce and expensive; remediating contaminated soil is costly; zoning and regulations can be difficult to navigate; and limited or no water supplies can prevent or impede agriculture efforts. Given the many benefits of community gardenting and urban farming, municipalities can help to address these challenges and find opportunities to support and expand urban agriculture initiatives within their communities. This section highlights key strategies to support urban farming that municipalities can utilize.
