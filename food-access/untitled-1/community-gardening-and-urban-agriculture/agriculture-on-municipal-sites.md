The community revitalization benefits of community gardening and urban agriculture are motivating increasingly more municipalities to consider how they can support community gardening and agricultural enterprise. These benefits are realized when residents can grow food that is both healthy and represents their diverse cultures; when communities grow strong through shared work; and when urban farmers are able to contribute to increasing local food access and be a part a vibrant network of local entrepreneurs.\[1\] Massachusetts is one of the main players, setting the stage for innovative urban agriculture solutions and policies – with several cities developing and implementing their own policies. Municipalities can facilitate community gardening and urban agriculture in a number of ways, including amending zoning, or developing urban agriculture overlay districts when zoning changes are not feasible; including goals for urban agriculture in planning efforts; removing ambiguous regulatory language that could impede urban agriculture; and fostering community dialogue around related public health, soil quality and racial equity issues. Because urban land is mostly built out and vacant areas are expensive, cities should proactively identify and connect growers to available municipal spaces for growing and raising food.\[2\] Experience of other Massachusetts communities should inform new municipal agriculture efforts.

Following are key strategies, part of a comprehensive approach to promote agriculture on municipal sites:

*  Develop an urban agriculture ordinance \(or an overlay district, where zoning changes are not feasible\).\[3\] \[4\] \(see Boston and Springfield examples\)
* Inventory and identify municipal sites that can be used for agriculture, and in addition to land, assess where rooftops and underutilized buildings can be used for growing food.\[5\]  \(see Boston example\)
* Enable permanent use of municipal sites for agriculture through easements, or long-term leases.\[6\]
* Once identified and dedicated, advertise municipal growing sites to growers. Provide services like soil testing, remediation and compost for growing sites, and technical assistance for sites that will require extensive engineering, such a rooftops and buildings.
