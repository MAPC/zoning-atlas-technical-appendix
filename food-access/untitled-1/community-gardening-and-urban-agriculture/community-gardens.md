Community gardens provide opportunities for members of the community to come together to use land to grow food. Community gardens can take many shapes and sizes—ranging from a small parcel to hundreds of acres. Community gardens can have immense benefits, including providing food access to those that may not otherwise have access to healthy fresh food. A study\[1\] out of Hood River, Oregon found that before introducing community gardens and resources to 42 low-income families, 31.2% had reported sometimes or frequently worrying about food running out before there was money available to buy more. After two gardening seasons, only 3.1% of those families had reported potential food insecurity.

Community gardens also have the potential to give purpose to vacant lots. This provides the opportunity to increase safety in communities and boost the property values of those parcels around it.  Community gardens can also function as a hub of the community boosting civic pride and social interactions among residents. There are numerous environmental benefits to community gardens including increased green space, greater ability to capture stormwater and runoff, reduced heat island effects and reduced emissions due to the reduction of food needing to be trucked in.

**Ways that municipalities can promote community gardens:\[2\]**

* Non-profits can be instrumental in carrying out programmatic efforts that ensure that those most likely to be food insecure have the skills and resources necessary to successfully participate in a community garden. These efforts could include:
  * Reserving a set number of plots in the community for low-income families
  * Offering low-income families and the elderly discounted rates on plots of land
  * Offering information sessions on how to use your garden plot most effectively
  * Creating a shared tool library that is available to all members of the garden
* Working with local business or organizations to get seeds or starts donated. 
* Include community gardens as a goal or strategy in the municipality’s comprehensive plan.
* Ensure that zoning does not prohibit the creation of community gardens by allowing community gardens as a by-right use in the all districts. Towns could also elect to adopt a Community Gardening Ordinance. See Resource Section for Springfield’s Community Gardening Ordinance
* Create a community garden policy committee.
* Create an inventory of vacant land and open space within the community that could be used to identify parcels that may be worth pursuing for community garden expansions. See the Resource Section for a report that highlights how this process was done in the City of Springfield, MA. 
* The following should be considered when looking for locations to site community gardens\[3\]:
  * The site needs to get at least six hours of direct sunlight a day in the spring, summer and fall
  *  Soil should be tested both to determine its nutrient levels and for possible contamination.
  * The site should have access to water
  * The site should be easily accessible for those that it is intended to be used by
  * The site should have a place to store tools and compost if those types of items are to be shared by the gardeners
  * The site should be visible in order to reduce the potential for theft or vandalism and to build community support for the garden 

There should a management plan in place to ensure that the plots are being actively gardened and the community spaces within the garden are being maintained.Plant edible trees \(fruit and nuts\) instead of ornamental trees on municipally owned land and make the public aware that the food is available for any one. Examples include: _Grow Food Northampton, Portland Fruit Tree Project_ and the _Seattle Beacon Food Forest_.

**Springfield, MA Community Gardening Ordinance** _\(Municipally-driven process\)_ 

The City of Springfield adopted a Community Gardening Ordinance in 2012. It outlines the process for establishing community gardens within the city. The ordinance identifies a number of procedures that make starting a community garden in the city easier. These include the Springfield Water and Sewer Commission waiving sewer disposal fees for sites that are used for gardening and the City providing a truck load of compost at the beginning of the season, to community gardens that request it. 

The ordinance also establishes a community gardening point person on the Springfield Food Policy Council \(SFPC\) that will act as a liason between the community gardeners and the various city departments involved. Lastly, the ordinance outlines the process for temporarily securing city-owned land to establish a community garden. The SFPC representative works with City departments of Housing, Parks and Recreation and Planning to identify parcels that would be appropriate for community gardens. Members of the public can then apply through the SFPC for access to garden on these sites. If the garden is maintained in compliance for a complete season, the City can elect to offer a five year agreement to the gardening entity, allowing that land to remain a garden. There are currently fifteen community gardens in the city, a 400% increase since 2014, when three community gardens were identified in “Food in the City”-- a report prepared for the Springfield Food Policy Council Urban Agriculture Committee.

**Grown Food Northampton\[4\]** _\(Partnership between Municipality and Non-profit\)_

Grow Food Northampton is a non-profit organization in Northampton, Massachusetts that is responsible for operating the state’s largest community farm. The 121 acre farm provides affordable land for farmers and over 250 community garden plots for community members. Programming offered through the farm ensures that children learn about the possibility and value of gardening and eating local food. Additionally, Grow Food Northampton has worked to ensure that those who are most likely to be food-insecure can take advantage of this community amenity. There are affordable community garden plots, reduced CSA shares and a portion of the crops that are harvested go to local assistance providers. 

The Grown Food Northampton movement started when a group of citizen’s banded together to advocate for local food production opportunities in the city. When the group found out that the city was pursuing the purchase of the Bean Farm to create recreation sports fields, the group sprang into action to show that this was prime farmland that needed to be preserved. The group was able to engage and collaborate with the city and the Trust for Public Land. They then worked to form a non-profit in order to raise money for the purpose of purchasing the land to create a community farm. After a successful fundraising campaign \(raising over $600,000\) Grow Food Northampton was able to purchase the land. The City of Northampton became the largest contributor by prepaying their 198-year lease on the land that would house the community garden plots. GFN also received $104,500 in Community Preservation Funds to develop the garden. Since then, GFN has strengthened its place in the community by expanding the community garden, offering produce at reduce rates to those most in need, donating tons of produce annually to service organization and offering farms shares, all while preserving this pristine farmland in the heart of the city.
