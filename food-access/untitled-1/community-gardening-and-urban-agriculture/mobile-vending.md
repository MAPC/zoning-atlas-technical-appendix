Mobile vending takes many forms and involves selling food out of any portable vehicle, including carts, kiosks and trucks. They are becoming more and more popular, and can increase access to healthy foods, especially in areas without access to large grocery stores. Like farmers markets, mobile vending is regulated by the food code. The same variance section applies and can be utilized by mobile vendors and board of health to promote mobile vending as a means for increasing the availability to healthy foods. New York City enacted a city ordinance that encourages access to fresh fruits and vegetables by committing to issue 1000 permits over the next 2 years to “green cart” vendors that only sell uncut produce.
