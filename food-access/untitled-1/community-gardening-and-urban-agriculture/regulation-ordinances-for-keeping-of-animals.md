Local boards of health in Massachusetts have the legal authority and responsibility to protect public health in cities and towns.  These boards often face complaints from community members, especially neighbors, relative to noise, odors and other issues surrounding the keeping of animals and the maintenance of farms.  While the odor from the normal maintenance of animals or the spreading on manure upon agricultural land or noise from livestock or farm equipment used in normal, generally acceptable farming procedures are not legally considered a nuisance and, therefore permissible, this does not stop conflicts from arising.

As a result, many cities and towns are considering or have enacted local board of health regulations addressing smaller farms and the keeping of animals.  Many existing, older Keeping of Animal regulations are challenging for small farms and for backyard farms.  These regulations often arbitrarily set maximum numbers of animals allowed and unnecessarily regulate issues of animal health, which is already regulated by the Department of Agricultural Resources \(MDAR\), the MA Society for the Protection of Cruelty to Animals and the Animal Rescue League of Massachusetts. 

However, the Town of Reading adopted animal regulations that utilize the Department of Agricultural Resources \(MDAR’s\) “Best Management Practices” as guidelines. Reading’s regulations permit applicants to demonstrate how they will meet these guidelines. The City of Cambridge has proposed ordinances that address the keeping of bees, hens and small animals through zoning and health ordinances. The City of Everett has also proposed an ordinance addressing the keeping on chickens with an emphasis on the culture of the community. About half of Massachusetts municipalities have established Agricultural Commissions. These commissions can provide guidance to Boards of Health on appropriate, community specific regulations. Reading’s regulation can be found in the Appendix to the Food Access Section of this document.
