Establishing fruit and vegetable gardens at schools can be another avenue to increase access to healthy foods and educate youth on the importance of healthy eating. Municipalities can support these efforts by encouraging school health and wellness committees to establish school gardens, school committees to adopt food and nutrition curriculum changes that complement school garden programs, and providing sustainable sources of funding to schools for the garden programs.

**Healthy Waltham and Waltham Public Schools**

Founded in 2004, Healthy Waltham is a nonprofit organization in Waltham that works to promote healthy, active lifestyles. The organization has partnered with several schools including McDevitt Middle School, Northeast Elementary School, and Stanley Elementary School to implement learning gardens. These gardens usually include raised beds in which the students plant a variety of veggies, fruits and herbs. The gardens are managed by volunteer, students and staff from the schools.  At the Northeast School, the special education and science teachers incorporate lessons about the garden for their students.
