# Farmland Preservation & Viability

“No Farms, No Food.”  This bumper sticker slogan provides a frank statement on why preserving local farmland is so important in creating healthy communities.  Massachusetts is fortunate to have some of the most productive farmland in New England and a rich history of food production for local markets.  Unfortunately, this finite resource continues to be converted to development – a permanent loss that compromises our ability to feed ourselves with healthy and locally grown food. Instead, we increasingly send food money far outside Massachusetts and receive industrialized products that have traveled thousands of miles, with accompanying loss of nutrition and flavor.

Local food production may impact food access in several ways. First, local food production often increases the diversity of local food availability—local farms often grow a greater diversity of crops than are available in supermarkets. Second, local food production often increases the number and spatial distribution of opportunities to purchase healthy food in a community. For example, farms often sell direct through farm stands, farmers markets, mobile markets, food deliveries, and community supported agriculture \(CSA\). Where they are in convenient to access, these markets can reduce transportation and shopping time. Third, some local farms directly support food access for those most in need. They donate excess produce to food pantries, or providing reduced cost CSA shares. Finally, local food production strengthens local economies and creates jobs. The economic impacts may increase the ability to purchase food for would-be farm workers and those who benefit from their spending. Visit the Local Food Impact Calculator recently developed by CISA to see how your food spending may impact local jobs \([http://www.buylocalfood.org/buy-local/local-food-calculator/](http://www.buylocalfood.org/buy-local/local-food-calculator/)\).

Several factors contribute to our farmland loss – agricultural competition from outside the region, tax policy, high land prices, and the aging of New England’s farm families are among them.  But the biggest culprit that we can control is wasteful land use, encouraged \(and often required\) by outdated zoning and subdivision laws.  This section presents strategies for improving local land use laws and taking advantage of state programs that provide funding for farmland preservation.

Preserving farmland has many benefits beyond providing access to healthy food.  Farmland is green space, contributing to community character.  Farms contribute to environmental systems, and provide food and cover for wildlife.  Farmland is a fiscal benefit to local government, and money earned by local farms from local sources stays in the community.  And farmland provides jobs on the farm and in support services or businesses, including Massachusetts’s robust tourism sector.  Along with food security, these reasons and more make preserving local farmland of the greatest importance.
