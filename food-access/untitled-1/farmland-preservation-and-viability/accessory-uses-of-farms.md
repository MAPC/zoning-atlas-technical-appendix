Farms need to be adaptable to exploit new sources of revenue.  This helps agricultural uses remain viable and thus competitive with other uses, helping prevent ANR carving of farmland or conversion of farmland to development.  Accessory uses to consider allowing by-right or through a special permit process:

* Forestry
* Processing of agricultural products and other value-added activities.
* Direct marketing of farm products, such as pick your own, farmersâ€™ markets, farm stands, direct sales to outlets such as schools and restaurants, produce auctions, etc.
* Farm-based alternative energies and commercial power generation, such as solar farms, windmills, and ethanol production.
* Accessory apartments and housing for farm labor.
* Bed and breakfasts, farm-based recreational or educational activities, and other agri-tourism uses.
* Temporary or repeating festivals, shows, events, auctions, camps, flea markets.
* Rental of land or buildings for businesses not related to farm production: e.g. equipment storage, parking, cold storage, small office uses.
