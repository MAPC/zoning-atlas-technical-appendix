By enrolling land into the Chapter 61A program, property owners are taxed at a substantially lower rate in exchange for keeping their land in agricultural production. In exchange, the farmer is subject to fees and back taxes if the land is converted to non-agricultural uses within a ten-year time period or within one year after the land is removed from the Chapter 61A program. This program makes farming more economically viable as the value of land and corresponding property taxes continue to rise.

We did not find evidence that Chapter 61A directly contributes to increased food access at the population level. However, this program supports continued agriculture in communities across the state, with associated environmental and economic co-benefits, including:

* The preservation of open spaces
* Less food being shipped from other places, thus, lowering carbon emissions from the food sector
* A more resilient community
* More money circulated in the local economy
* The preservation of local jobs

### **Challenges with the Chapter 61A Program**

Land in the Chapter 61A program that is being sold or converted to residential, commercial or industrial uses triggers a right of first refusal \(ROFR\) that benefits the municipality. The municipality is given 120 days to determine if they would like to acquire the land.  If the land is being converted without sale, the municipality can purchase the land at full and fair market value—as determined by an independent appraiser. If the land is being sold, the municipality can make a bona fide offer based off an executed purchase and sale agreement that is included in the notification packet. In most instances, municipalities are not able to take advantage of this first right of refusal. The most common barriers include a lack of funding to buy the parcels and the inability to take action within the short time frame outlined in Chapter 61’s language.

### **Potential Solutions to the barriers limiting municipalities’ execution of their right of first refusal**

* Evaluate Chapter 61A lands in the municipality and prioritize which would be of greatest importance to the town. The parcels should be identified and ranked based on agreed-upon criteria and food access should be prioritized. For example, a community may prioritize productive and economically viable farmland, or land that is in close proximity to populations of need. The resulting prioritized list of potential 61A acquisitions can help the community respond more quickly to the right of first refusal notice when received. The prioritized list can also be used to initiate outreach to selected landowners to better understand their future intentions and timeline. Some municipalities decide to incorporate this ranking and process into their Open Space and Recreation Plan \(OSRP\).
* Formalize a process for responding to Chapter 61A notifications. This process should identify a point-person who will shepherd the notification through the process and map out which town committees are required to take action in what order. The formalized process should ensure that the community is able to respond to the notification within the 120 day time period. See the resources section for an example of how Stow, MA has formalized their process.
* Create a Conservation Fund for the express purpose of acquiring land that becomes available through the Chapter 61A right of first refusal. Conveyance and roll back taxes collected from Chapter 61A land that is converted could be directed to this fund instead of the general fund to be used for future acquisitions.
* Explore the feasibility of using Community Preservation Act funding to acquire lands that trigger the right of first refusal.
* Develop relationships with local conservation organizations before land becomes available. This partnership can be valuable as the municipality can formally assign the right of first refusal to the organization if the municipality does not have the means or desire to acquire the land. 
* Given the challenges communities face in acquiring land that is coming out of Chapter 61A, some people question whether the program is actually effective at preserving farmland over the long-term. Municipalities could work together to advocate for revisions to Chapter 61A in order to make it a more effective program.

**Mainstone Farm- Wayland, MA** \[1\],\[2\]  
The preservation of the Mainstone Farm is a good example of a proactive partnership between the municipality, local land trust and owners of the property. The Hamlen Family in Wayland, MA has owned and actively farmed over 200 acres of land since the 1870s. This land is currently part of the Chapter 61A program and was of value to the Town of Wayland and the Sudbury Valley Trustees. The Town and SVT were able to work collaboratively with the land owners to ensure that the land stays as an agricultural use well into the future. The land owners were willing to sell the town a perpetual conservation restriction on the land, which was assessed for $17 million, for $15 million.
