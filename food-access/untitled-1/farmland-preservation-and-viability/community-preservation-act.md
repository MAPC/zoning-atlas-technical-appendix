The Community Preservation Act \(M.G.L. Chapter 44B\) allows municipalities that accept its provisions to create a Community Preservation Fund by assessing a surcharge of up to 3% on annual real estate taxes and to appropriate monies in that fund for open space/recreation, historic resource and affordable housing purposes. Communities that impose the surcharge also receive additional monies for their special fund from a state trust fund created by imposing a surcharge on documents recorded at the Registry of Deeds or Land Court.

#### **Use of Funds**

Funds raised by CPA are administered by a locally-created [Community Preservation Committee](http://www.communitypreservation.org/CPCs), which reviews and makes recommendations on CPA projects to the community’s legislative body.  A minimum of 10% of the funds must be spent on each of the three following categories: open space/recreation, historic preservation, and community housing. The remaining 70% of the funds are undesignated, and can be used for any allowable project in these CPA categories. 

Specifically, for purposes of healthy communities and food access, CPA funds may be spent on the acquisition, creation, and preservation of open space, including farmland, and for the rehabilitation or restoration of any open space that has been acquired or created using CPA funds.  CPA funds may be also used for the acquisition of land to be used for outdoor recreation, the rehabilitation of existing, outdoor recreational facilities or for the creation of new recreational facilities on land a community already owns.  A permanent deed restriction is required for all real property interests acquired under CPA.   

Often, communities will use CPA funds as local match money, used to acquire state and federal grants, allowing more expensive projects to be funded.  Seekonk permanently preserved 68 acres of farmland for agricultural purposes using $147,000 of CPA funds to leverage $588K from the state’s Agricultural Preservation Restrictions program to meet the property value appraisal.  Communities also find it helpful sometimes to partner with land trusts or other experienced third-party conservation organizations to manage negotiations and hold easements. To negotiate a complex deal to acquire development rights of two parcels comprising the 60-acre Murray Farm in Bridgewater that was under threat of development, the Town turned to the Trust for Public Land. The Trust paid for appraisals, putting together a funding packet, and other project-related costs, while the Town provided $1.3 million to purchase the development rights - $882,000 in CPA funds, and $400,000 from a Local Acquisitions for Natural Diversity \(LAND\) grant provided by the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs.

Since the Act’s passage in 2000, over **$542.12 million** has been distributed from the statewide trust fund to participating communities, helping preserve over 23,000 acres of open space and fund almost 1500 recreation projects.  The conservation of historic Elmwood Farm in Hopkinton, 242-acre Cole Property in Carver, and 60-acre Murray Farm in Bridgewater are examples of CPA projects that permanently protect local agricultural land.  Hanover’s Forge Pond Park, Newburyport’s Clipper City Rail Trail, and Hamilton’s Patton Park Playground are successful examples of recreation projects.

CPA funds can also be used to build affordable housing. Some CPA housing projects include buildings with non-housing uses on the ground floor. This square footage could be set aside as a small healthy food retail location, providing fresh, healthy options in neighborhoods.

#### **Adoption**

To date 161 municipalities have adopted the act:

![Map of Massachusetts with communities that have adopted CPA highlighted](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%285%29.png)

Municipalities must adopt CPA by referendum, placed on the ballot by one of two methods:

1. _Local legislative action._ 

The legislative body must pass a resolution accepting G. L. c. 44B, §§ 3 through 7 and approve the amount of the surcharge, which cannot exceed 3%, and spell out any exemptions.  A ballot question to approve the acceptance must be placed before the voters at the next regularly scheduled municipal or state election.  If the next regularly scheduled election is a municipal election, the legislative body must act in sufficient time to give the city or town clerk at least 35 days advance notice to place the question on the ballot. If the next election is a state election, the secretary of state must receive at least 60 days written notice to place the question on the ballot for that municipality.

The form of the ballot question is set forth in the Act and must read as follows: “Shall the \(city or town\) accept sections 3 to 7, inclusive of chapter 44B of the General Laws, as approved by its legislative body, a summary of which appears below?”  A fair and concise summary of the Community Preservation Act provisions must appear on the ballot underneath the question, prepared by the city solicitor or town counsel.  It must include the surcharge percentage approved by the legislative body, and any exemptions.  A sample summary appears on the Secretary’s website: [http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elecpa/cpaidx.htm](http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elecpa/cpaidx.htm)

_2. A ballot question petition._ 

Voters of the city or town may file a ballot question petition to have a question seeking acceptance of the act, approval of a specific surcharge percentage and approval of any allowable exemptions to be placed on the ballot. The petition form itself must include the surcharge percentage and any exemptions, if any, proposed for approval.  See [http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elecpa/cpaidx.htm](http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/elecpa/cpaidx.htm) for sample petition language.

The petition must be signed by at least 5% of the registered voters of the city or town and submitted to the local board of registrars of voters, board of election commissioners or election commission for certification of signatures. The board or commission must certify the signatures within 7 days of filing.  If the petition is signed by the required number of voters, the city or town clerk or secretary of state must then place the question on the ballot at the next regular municipal or state election held after certain minimum time periods.

If the question is to appear on a municipal election ballot, petitions must be submitted to the board or commission for certification at least 42 days before the municipal election so that certification can be completed at least 35 days before the election. If the question is to appear on a state election ballot, the petitions must be submitted to the board or commission at least 67 days before the state election so that certification can be completed and notice given to the Secretary of the Commonwealth at least 60 days certification of the signatures.  It is advisable for petitioners to submit a petition for certification as early as possible so that there is sufficient time to gather additional signatures should any problems with the signatures be identified in the certification process.

A ballot question proposed by petition should be placed on the ballot in the same form as described under \(1\) above.  Additionally, the city solicitor or town counsel should prepare a fair and concise summary \(see link under \(1\) above\), to be printed below the question and includes the surcharge percentage and any exemptions.

#### **Surcharge and Exemptions**

The surcharge may not exceed 3%, though this amount is often a big ask for many communities.  Those needing to rally public support for CPA often chose amounts of 1% or 1.5%.  Adding exemptions also helps encourage support.  Any or all of the following exceptions may be included, per Section 2 of the Act:

* Property owned and occupied by a person who would qualify for low income housing \(income = or &lt; 80% area mean\), or low or moderate income senior housing \(60+, income = or &lt; 100% area median\); 
* Commercial and industrial property in cities or towns with classified tax rates; 
* The first $100,000 of the value of residential property; 
* The first $100,000 of the value of commercial and industrial property.
