| N/A. Some Evidence for effectiveness of use of CLTs for housing | All | Municipal Programs and Actions | Economic,  Environmental, Physical Health, Social |

As outlined in the _Massachusetts Local Food Action Plan_, “community land trusts are nonprofit, community-based corporations with a place-based membership and commitment to the use and stewardship of land on behalf of the local population.” Traditionally, community land trusts were used to ensure that affordable housing remained in the neighborhood even as market values increased. Today, many community land trusts \(CLTs\) are expanding into activities related to food access, including providing commercial spaces for local food businesses and land for urban agriculture,  community gardens and community farms. This use of CLT land for community gardens has the ability to provide land for farming in environments where the parcels are not big enough to qualify for protection under Chapter 61A or the Agricultural Preservation Restriction \(APR\) Program or where those wishing to garden or farm do not have the resources to secure a parcel of land themselves.

Because gardening can be out of the scope of what CLTs traditionally do, there are a number of challenges that can arise. These include:

* Reasonable ground lease rates may not be enough to cover CLT operating costs, which can be higher than housing-related operating costs, due to the additional time it takes to organize and operate the agricultural uses.
* There may be potential gaps in the CLT’s core competencies. Many CLTs are knowledgeable in the arena of housing, but do not have technical expertise related to agricultural production.
* Hesitation from the board to step out of the CLT’s traditional scope of work.

Municipalities may be able to help CLTs overcome some of these common challenges by:

* Providing administrative and financial support to new CLTs or CLTs that are broadening their mission to include agriculture ventures
* Donating or selling excess city land at a discount to CLTs

Using Community Land Trusts for agriculture shares many of the same benefits as other urban agriculture efforts including improved access to nutritious food, ecological restoration, the creation or maintenance of open spaces, and potential opportunities for education and job training. CLTs can also bring together diverse populations, build social capital, and promote empowerment through community building. The unique benefit of the CLT model for small-scale community agriculture is its ability to preserve land for agriculture which may not be eligible for other state agricultural preservations, \(e.g. an APR or Chapter 61A\).
