Farmers can have difficulty getting a foot into stores selling local products, particularly for new farmers in farm-rich areas.  Farmers’ markets are a great way to connect directly with local consumers, but these have limited days and hours, rules about the need for products to originate on the seller’s land and frequently cap the number of vendor spots for products.  A roadside stand has none of these restrictions, can provide an important source of income for farmers and local employment if business is steady, and might offer discounted prices for blemished produce. 

M.G.L. 40A Section 3 exempts the sale of produce, wine, and dairy products on commercial farms, provided that 25% of the products have been produced by the landowner or lessee.  The exemption is limited to parcels of 5 acres, or 2 acres if the gross sales generated are at least $1000 per acre annually.

We recommend zoning by-laws make this exemption explicit, allowing farm stands as by-right uses in districts which permit commercial agriculture. To address concerns about farm stands becoming de facto convenience stores and large markets, a special permit might be required for the sale of products not raised in the town. Additionally, zoning regulations regarding parking or signage could be relaxed for farm stand uses. Applying the signage and parking regulations that would be used for a small store could be particularly onerous for a small farm with a stand on the property.
