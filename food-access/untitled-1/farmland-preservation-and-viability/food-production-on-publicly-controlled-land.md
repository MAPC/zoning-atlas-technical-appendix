Placing food production close to resident populations helps promote healthy food alternatives. In many communities, especially those in urban and developed areas, there is limited land available for food production. Communities should identify under-used public and private non-profit land that could be used for community food production, institutions that could undertake and oversee production, and any ways to recuperate associated costs. Sites for food production might include portions of parkland, cemeteries, school yards, rights of way, government buildings, libraries, community centers and publicly controlled vacant land, open space, or woodlands. Schools, neighborhood groups, community garden organizations, cooperatives, and small-scale farmers might be given access to the land, with costs recuperated thru produce sales, rental fees, or other means. Efforts could be encoded in Open Space and Recreation Plans and land management plans.
