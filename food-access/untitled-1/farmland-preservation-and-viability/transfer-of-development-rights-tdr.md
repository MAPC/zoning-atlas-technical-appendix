A Transfer of Development Rights \(TDR\) program consists of separating the right to develop from other property rights, allowing developers to purchase these rights from “sending” areas \(those with conservation value\) to use for increased development in “receiving” areas \(those with development value\). Development rights can either be purchased directly from a property in the sending area or through an in-lieu mechanism, which allows applicants to pay a contribution, equal in value to the required development rights, to the Town to be used for future purchases of agricultural preservation restrictions \(APRs\). TRD helps farms remain viable. Farms get a cash-infusion without losing the right to continue to occupy and work the land. The community benefits from additional preserved farmland without having to pay for it. The developer enjoys the right to develop their site more intensely. 

In order to be effective, a TDR program requires “receiving” areas with significant development potential, as well as underlying zoning that sufficiently incentivizes use of the TDR provisions. In other words the cost-benefit of using the TRD program needs to work out financially for the developer \(i.e. “pencil out”\).

**Hadley, MA Farmland Preservation Bylaw**  
[**http://ecode360.com/13511544**](http://ecode360.com/13511544)

One of the state’s most successful examples of TDR is the “Farmland Preservation Bylaw” subsection of Hadley’s zoning bylaw, where development in the receiving commercial/industrial districts along Route 9 in Hadley often requires the purchase of development rights from landowners within the farmland preservation district in order to meet parking and bulk requirements. The zoning bylaw’s Table of Exchange Standards defines the value of developable farmland rights in terms of bonuses: 

_1 acre of developable farmland equals 2,000 square feet of additional commercial or industrial floor area plus a reduction in parking of 20 spaces; 2 additional bedrooms in senior housing developments._ 

Local planners cite Hadley’s stringent minimum parking and coverage requirements as driving the TDR mechanism and ensuring its success. Also helpful are the community’s large tracts of high quality farmland in the sending area, coupled with farmers who are interested in providing purchasable development rights. The payment-in-lieu mechanism has been used more often than direct purchase of development rights. It has enabled the Town of Hadley to place APRs on several hundred acres of farmland.

It is worth noting that both of the zoning mechanisms that make the Hadley example viable—the underlying zoning’s high number of required parking spaces and its low lot coverage allowance—are in conflict with strategies outlined elsewhere in the HCDTK to improve walkability.
