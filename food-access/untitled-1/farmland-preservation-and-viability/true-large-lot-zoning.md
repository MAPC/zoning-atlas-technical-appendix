True large lot zoning, with a minimum lot size of 15 to 25 acres or more, is the most straight- forward method of using zoning regulation to protect open tracts of land. Preserving lots of this size can help to ensure that farming on this land is possible in the future. Generally this method is best suited for communities with large areas of existing farm and forest land. Depending on development pressure and existing zoning, there may be political pushback from owners who foresee a depreciation of land values. We are not aware of any communities in Massachusetts that have established minimum lot sizes larger than 5 acres. Rather than focusing on minimum lot size, it may be useful to think about overall density per dwelling unit. Use of Natural Resource Protection Zoning \(NRPZ\) or another form of cluster zoning can increase the functional minimum density in some areas to 5-10 acres per dwelling unit. For example, Shutesbury, MA, which has adopted NRPZ requires a minimum 10 acre lot size if the dwelling is greater than 500 feet from the roadway.
