# Food Business Infrastructure

### Food Business Infrastructure

Massachusetts communities are increasingly investing in food business infrastructure that supports business development and increases the healthy food options available to residents. Food business infrastructure includes facilities for food processing and storage and equipment and mechanisms for getting food to consumers. Through business incubation in shared kitchen facilities, Massachusettsâ€™ Commonwealth Kitchen, the Western Massachusetts Processing Center, and Stockpot Malden are spurring food business development and workforce training initiatives that are improving healthy food options. Statewide recommendations of the Massachusetts Local Food Action Plan identify the opportunity to utilize empty facilities for expanded food processing, and it calls for inventorying infrastructure and encouraging food business activities. Municipalities can facilitate developing food business infrastructure development, and particularly with larger initiatives, they should do so in coordination with regional and statewide efforts. Projects that would warrant regional coordination would include development or redevelopment projects for aggregation, storage and distribution facilities that would serve multiple municipalities. Small-scale projects, like opening kitchens in municipal facilities to residents interested in starting a food business, or hunger relief organizations, could extend valuable and underutilized resources that would have local economic and health benefits.

{% tab title="Additional Strategies" %}
* Assess opportunities for shared use of commercial kitchens in community facilities: 
  * Across the Commonwealth, enterprising residents have established processing and distribution facilities that transform raw ingredients into other forms of food. These facilities tend to have large commercial kitchens that could be opened up for shared use by community members for cooking and nutrition training as well as incubators to support new food entrepreneurs who lack kitchen space to create their food products. Municipalities could support shared use commercial kitchens by providing business development technical assistance; conducting regulatory reviews to identify and address regulations that pose barriers to opening the facilities for shared use; and addressing other barriers, such as obtaining insurance.
  * Leverage Points: Municipal Programs and Actions, Municipal Policies
* Food Hubs: 
  * A food hub is an entity that aggregates, processes, and markets food from small to mid-size farms providing larger scale distribution and wider access to food markets than what these farms could do individually. Food hubs can potentially increase availability of healthy, local foods for community institutions such a schools as well as enhance the local economy of municipalities as they provide additional jobs for residents and bolster local farms. Municipalities can support these hubs by providing business development technical assistance, economic development grants, and low cost lots or buildings for use.
