Food Innovation Districts are clusters of food-oriented businesses and related activities that leverage the collaborative benefits that come with being located near one another. These business districts often include markets, food business incubators, common storage, packaging facilities, and distribution services. In addition to hosting food production-oriented businesses, they also include community elements such as harvesting and gleaning programs and community kitchens. They foster business collaboration, sharing knowledge, resources and services, marketing and promotional efforts, and as a result improve opportunities for startup firms to grow and thrive. Beyond this, Food Innovation Districts also enable communities to redevelop underutilized facilities and infrastructure; increase the demand for local farm products; increase the potential for regional availability and distribution of healthy foods, and thereby support resident health; and can become distinguishing features of communities and can attract additional community investments. Food Innovation Districts are a major development or redevelopment undertaking, and can be realized with the significant commitment and planning by a broad range of stakeholders, including elected municipal officials, planners, economic development specialists, and community champions. Especially where Food Innovation Districts facilitate food entrepreneurship and distribution across municipal boundaries, regional planning agencies should be engaged. The toolkit, Food Innovation Districts: An Economic Gardening Tool offers guidance on the development process. Food Innovation District development requires a coordinated effort that includes developing a common vision, identifying potential sites and existing community assets, determining demand and opportunities for types of food business, and addressing zoning, financing, and overall feasibility. The multiple economic, public health, and placemaking benefits of Food Innovation Districts are the primary motivations for developing these in communities.

The Franklin County Community Development Corporation \(FCCDC\), and its food business incubator, the Western Massachusetts Food Processing Center \(WMFPC\) are the anchor entities of the Greenfield’s food innovation district. They are accompanied by a range of other businesses. Real Pickles and Katalyst Kombucha got their start as tenants of the WMFPC; Lefty’s Brewery joined as a neighbor; and Our Family Farms, and Equal Exchange became office tenants of the FCCDC Venture Center. Franklin County Community Meals, a food access organization is also located here. And, within the WMFPC over 45 food businesses are tenants of the processing center and business incubator. FCCDC and the WMFPC partners with Greenfield Community College, the Regional Employment Board and local prison on food system-related workforce training and education. Important regional partnerships with Community Involved in Sustaining Agriculture and the PV Grows Investment Fund support business development, financing and technical assistance for businesses of the food innovation district.
