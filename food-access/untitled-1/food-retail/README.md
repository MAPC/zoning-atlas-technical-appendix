# Food Retail

Food retail encompasses the major food access points where people purchase their food items and include grocery stores and supermarkets, convenience stores and bodegas, farmers markets, specialty food stores, and warehouse clubs and supercenters. In Massachusetts, there are approximately 9500 retailers and this sheer volume of stores illustrates the importance of food retail in the food system.  As most communities have at least one type of food retailer, food retail is a space where municipalities have the opportunity to improve access to and availability of healthy foods for their residents.

Massachusetts has fewer healthy food retail stores per capita than almost any other state in the country. Residents in Boston, Springfield, Brockton, Lowell, Fitchburg and other Massachusetts cities, have even more limited options than the state generally.\[1\] Research shows that where communities have limited food options, people have higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related health issues, and these conditions are particularly pronounced in low-income communities of color.\[2\]

Research also shows that where people have access to nutritious fruits and vegetables through grocery stores or neighborhood markets, people eat better and are healthier.\[3\] Strategic expansion and development of healthy food retail in Massachusetts communities is an important strategy to improving the health of its residents. In addition to this core benefit, supporting expansion or development of food businesses also impact the economy, and can generate local employment, spur adjacent commercial activity, and contribute to the municipal tax base.\[4\]  

Municipalities can facilitate healthy food retail in a number of ways, from encouraging new grocery store developments to supporting existing neighborhood markets in expanding or stocking healthier options. The following strategies present ways in which municipalities and their partners can identify the communitiesâ€™ healthy food retail needs and opportunities, remove impediments that could deter food retail development, and incentivize healthy food retail development, redevelopment and expansion. In all instances, improving healthy food retail requires a significant investment of time and resources by a range of partners. To have the greatest impact, the following municipal-level strategies should be considered as a part of a comprehensive strategy that leverages state, federal and private resources, where possible and necessary.

The Massachusetts Food Trust will provide loans, grants, and technical assistance for new and expanding healthy food retailers and local food enterprises in low and moderate income communities.
