Although there is no regulatory definition for a farmers market, MDAR defines them as “a public market for the primary purpose of connecting and mutually benefiting Massachusetts farmers, communities, and shoppers while promoting and selling products grown and raised by participating farmers.”\[1\]  Originally, farmers markets sold locally-grown, uncut fruits and vegetables.  These types of farmers markets are exempt from any board of health regulation or permit requirement.  Farmers markets that sell fresh uncut produce and unprocessed honey, maple syrup and/or fresh eggs are also not required to have a local board of health permit.  However, farmers markets that sell processed foods \(blueberries vs. blueberry pies\) and food products other than those mentioned above are considered food establishments and must be licensed by the local board of health pursuant to 105 CMR 590.00. 

The challenge is that 105 CMR 590.00 \(the code\) is based on the 1999 U. S. Food Code.  Farmers markets have evolved over the years and unfortunately the Massachusetts food code has not.  As a result, many of the activities at farmers markets are not adequately addressed in the Massachusetts food code. Food demonstrations and food sampling can present challenges for local boards of health and some boards simply refuse to permit these activities. This practice does not promote selling locally grown products. Instead, local boards should work with local farmers to permit these activities by assuring that they are done safely. The local board of health has the authority to prohibit any food-handling operation that cannot be safely performed and may prohibit the sale of certain food items if the items cannot be handled and maintained in accordance with the code requirements. However, determining whether food-handling operations can be safely performed, and whether food products can be safely sold can prove difficult.

Section 8-103 of the food code permits local boards of health to grant a variance to the code requirements by modifying or waiving the requirements of the code if, in the opinion of the board, a health hazard or nuisance will not result from the variance. In other words, the food-handling operation or the sale of certain food items can be done safely. For instance, the code requires that produce be stored off the ground. However, there are different interpretations about what this means. If the farmer can demonstrate that his or her means of storage is safe and therefore meets the spirit of the code, the board has the ability to grant that farmer a variance from this requirement.
