Enacting restrictions in retail stores is commonplace in the world of tobacco control.  A common restriction is to prohibit self-service displays of tobacco.  The rationale behind this policy is to thwart the industry’s intentional, strategic attempts to place its products where youth can see them and take them. The same rationale can hold true for candy and other junk foods. Supermarkets already have candy-free check-out lanes to help parents and others who don’t want their kids grabbing a candy bar while in the shopping cart. This strategy can also discourage impulse purchases and the opportunity for shoplifting.  This strategy can be accomplished by means of a local board of health regulation.  A model regulation is included in the Appendix.
