**Framingham, MA**  
_**Southeast Framingham Neighborhood Action Plan**_  
****A density bonus is a zoning tool that enables developers to build more units or taller buildings, in exchange for defined community benefits. The Southeast Framingham Neighborhood Action Plan recommends offering prospective developers a density bonus that would allow an increased building height and increase floor-to-area ratio in exchange for two of the specified community benefits. One of these community benefits is a full service supermarket. 

The need for a convenient local grocery store was expressed in the planning process when Framingham residents described a lack of grocery stores nearby and challenges in getting to the grocery store with public transportation and an informal shuttle service. As a result, planners and community members worked together to include a supermarket in the list of community benefits. By incentivizing developers through this approach, future developments in Southeast Framingham neighborhood are more likely to meet specified community needs, and potentially full-service grocery store development.
