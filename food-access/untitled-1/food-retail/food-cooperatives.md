A food cooperative is a food business that is member owned and controlled and exists for the benefit of its members. Membership in a cooperative is open to anyone and completely voluntary. Food co-ops have been used as a way to provide full service grocery stores to lower income communities. Because food co-ops are member-driven, rather than profit-driven, it is sometimes possible to establish a food co-op in a location that a for-profit food market would avoid due to less than ideal market-characteristics or other factors.

Food co-ops serve not only to increase access and availability of food but can also serve as important community institutions providing nutrition education, organizational events, jobs for residents, and opportunities for members to build skills and social networks. Prices at food co-ops can be cheaper than at for-profit food outlets, but this is not always the case. 

While co-ops are one way to provide full service groceries for limited food access areas, they do require significant upfront capital and time to establish. Food systems advocates and municipalities can support these entities by providing funding to help establish the co-op, subsidizing ownership costs for residents, or providing discounted land or buildings.
