Ensure municipal zoning ordinance allows for business and mixed-use \(commercial and residential\) development, and that it explicitly names grocery stores as a permitted use. Including permitted uses in local ordinances removes administrative barriers to establishing their use and protects their existence.\[1\] Somerville, Massachusetts is currently in the process of overhauling its zoning code, which includes provisions for improving access to fresh food and by permitting adaptive reuse of commercial buildings in Neighborhood Residence districts for food stores. In its draft form the zoning code explicitly permits Fresh Food and/or Grocery Stores in city districts. This use is permitted by right with limitations in neighborhood residences and urban residences, permitted by right in 3-10 Story Mixed-Use buildings, and permitted by special permit in Commercial Industrial districts.\[2\]
