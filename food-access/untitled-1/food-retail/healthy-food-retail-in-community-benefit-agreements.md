A Community Benefit Agreement \(CBA\) is an agreement between a developer and a municipality or community groups that states the range of benefits the developer agrees to provide for the community as part of the development project. The benefits included should reflect the needs of the community and can include parks, wage requirements, community, or child care centers. Municipalities can use CBAs as a way to add healthy retail to the communities, for example, by negotiating for the provision of a full service grocery store or other healthy retail by these developers.
