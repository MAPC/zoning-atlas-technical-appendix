Communities can perform a food retail assessment that identifies neighborhoods where healthy food retail options are limited, as a means to understand where food retail investments should be targeted. Such an assessment should inventory and map the full service food stores in the neighborhood, and may also include demographic data on income and health. Several analyses exist that identify communities in Massachusetts that have limited healthy food retail options; these are listed below.
