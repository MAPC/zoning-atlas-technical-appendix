A business license ordinance can be a powerful tool to help increase the availability of healthy foods in communities. Small retailers such as convenience stores, dollar stores, and gas stations often carry food items but have limited healthy food options. In most municipalities, these retailers are required to apply for a business license in order to operate. A licensing ordinance or bylaw can require small retailers to include healthy food options as part of their product offerings. These ordinances or bylaws typically include a statement of purpose, definitions, requirements and prohibitions, and enforcement and penalties. Offering additional incentives such as tax breaks, business technical assistance, or marketing support can also help with ensuring compliance from retailers. 

License ordinances or bylaws are an effective mechanism as they can help to ensure efforts to improve healthy food availability are sustainable and that these efforts have a broader reach as they can apply to all small retailers within the community. Successful implementation of this strategy needs strong municipal, community and business partnerships, outreach and education of small retailers, and resources for enforcement.
