Market analyses and residential surveys can provide communities with a better understanding of the food retail potential, inform strategies for improving the food environment, and communicate the opportunity to food retailers.

Residential surveys can provide information about the particular shopping habits, preferences and needs of a community, and can inform the market opportunity for particular types of food retail.

Retail market analyses evaluate the demand and supply for stores in specified trade areas, and estimate the opportunity for new or expanded retail. Demand for food retail can be estimated by collecting information on residents’ grocery store spending; food retail supply can be measured by evaluating sales data of nearby food stores. Additional demographic data \(income, homeownership, and educational attainment\), real estate data \(i.e. number planned or permitted developments\) and access data \(roads, transit, and car ownership\) may be included in a more extensive market analysis.

Initially, communities may choose to conduct a basic market analysis that estimates the scale of food retail potential, to help communities understand whether their community can, for example, support expansion to a smaller, existing market, or a new supermarket. Once a community is in advanced stages of planning, they may hire specialists to conduct a more extensive market analysis.

Natick, MA: **The Natick Center Plan, Retail Market Analysis** [http://www.mapc.org/sites/default/files/Natick%20Center%20Plan%20Report\_May2016.pdf](http://www.mapc.org/sites/default/files/Natick%20Center%20Plan%20Report_May2016.pdf)

The analysis estimates that $1,750 sales per square foot is needed to support a grocery store that is 10,000 square feet. Estimating average household grocery spending at $135 weekly, the area would need to be about 2,500 households. With 1,800 nearby households, the study concluded that a grocery store would not be viable in the Natick Center study area.

This analysis estimates the purchasing capacity of an area by calculating 7 percent of household income in the study area, estimated to be the percentage of income spent on groceries. It then calculates 60 percent of this total as the percentage of food spending that could be captured locally. Grocery store demand is derived by translating the purchasing power into the number of square feet of food retail that could be supported. The study
