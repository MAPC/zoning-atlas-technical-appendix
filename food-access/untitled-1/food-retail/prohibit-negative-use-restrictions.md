Private owners may restrict uses of their property in private agreements, including in deeds, covenants, or leases. Such a restriction is deemed a Negative Use Restriction. Where municipalities are interested in encouraging uses that benefit the public, and where these uses are in line with zoning, they can prohibit private owners from disallowing the use of their property for such uses. To encourage grocery store development, municipalities can include in their zoning code prohibitions of Negative Use Restrictions that would disallow the development of grocery stores.. Madison, Wisconsin \(28.147\) and Chicago, Illinois \(17-1-1004\) prohibit negative use restrictions of grocery stores in their zoning code.
