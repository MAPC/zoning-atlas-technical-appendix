Municipalities may seek expedited permitting processes to increase the efficiency of the review of and decision-making process for economic or housing development project proposals. Where municipalities have identified a need for additional grocery stores, it may be appropriate for municipalities to pursue an expedited permitting process in grocery store development. This can be done by designating those areas with limited food retail as ‘priority development sites,’ on a State inventory map to the raise the level of awareness to prospective developers that a community is promoting expedited permitting as a means to encourage this type of grocery store development. 

Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 43D establishes rules for the Expedited Permitting Program that gives Massachusetts municipalities the ability to promote commercial or mixed-use development on pre-approved parcels, by offering expedited local permitting on those parcels. Qualifying parcels must meet a range of criteria, including being zoned for commercial, industrial or mixed-use zoning; being eligible for development that includes at least 50,000 square feet of gross floor area; and being designated by municipalities as ‘priority development sites’. Municipalities must go through a process to identify and designate priority development sites in order to qualify for expedited permitting and related technical and financial assistance.\[1\]
