With assistance from experts familiar with available city, state and federal incentives, the development process and the grocery industry, municipalities and partners can develop and communicate a tax incentive package to encourage prospective grocery store developers. Incentives packages alone will not make a grocery store viable, but they can reduce the costs associated with development. Because most tax incentives are not designed for grocery stores, and the process requires expert knowledge of several industry and development facets, grocery store advocates should expect assembling an effective tax incentive package to take a significant amount of effort.
