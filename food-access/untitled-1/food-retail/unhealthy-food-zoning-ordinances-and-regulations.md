Fast food is generally considered to be mass-produced, inexpensive food that is prepared and served quickly to consumers, often through drive-thru service, that tends to be high in fat and low in nutritional value. Fast food restaurants are captured in the definition of formula businesses, which have been defined as “ a type of retail sales establishment, restaurant, tavern, bar, or take-out food establishment which is under common ownership or control or is a franchise, and is one of ten or more other businesses or establishment worldwide maintaining two or more of the following features:

* Standardized menu or standardized array of merchandise with 50% or more of in-stock merchandise from a single distributor bearing uniform markings.
* Trademark or service mark, defined as a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination or words, phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods from one party from those off others, on products or as part of store design, such as cups, napkins, bags, boxes, wrappers, straws, store signs or advertising devices.
* Standardized color scheme used throughout the interior or exterior of the establishment, including but not limited to, graphics, awnings, signage, and the like visible from the exterior of the structure.
* Standardized interior décor, including, but not limited to, style of furniture, wall coverings, permanent fixtures, displays, window treatments.
* Standardized uniform, including but not limited to aprons, pants, shirts, smocks or dresses, hat, and pins \(other than name tags\).”  \[1\]

Zoning restrictions on fast food restaurants have been enacted across the country and in Massachusetts not based on health, but rather based on the following:\[2\]

* To lessen traffic congestion
* To preserve walkability \(by limiting or not allowing drive-thrus\)
* To preserve the aesthetic qualities of the community
* To decrease potential to create a nuisance \(e.g., litter, noise, odors, loitering\)
* To protect vibrant small business sector
* To preserve the distinctive character of the district
* To maintain a unique retail and dining experience

Links to the zoning bylaws from Nantucket, MA and Concord, MA are included in the Resources section.

It is well known that easy access to low-nutrient, high-calorie food is one factor that contributes to the increase in obesity that we face today. Local zoning is enacted pursuant to the police powers of a municipality to protect the health, safety and welfare of its residents. Since obesity is clearly a health risk, it falls within the police powers of a municipality to regulate through zoning ordinances and by-laws. Relevant sections of a proposed zoning ordinance based on the health effects of fast food are included in the Appendix.
