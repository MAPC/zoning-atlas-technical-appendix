# Land Use & Urban Design

Community design \(otherwise known as land use and urban design\), affects food access in multiple ways.  Not only can community design facilitate \(and in certain circumstance even require\) food access by affecting where grocery stores and other retail food outlets—farmer’s markets, corner stores, mobile markets, community gardens, urban farms, food stands, etc. are located, but it can also create the physical environment in and around the stores which impacts the ability of marginalized populations to access these food retail outlets. The work of Tach and Amorim investigating three different neighborhoods with relative food access problems and a variety of mitigating community design characteristics, shows the importance of walkability and the need for multiple and varied retail food outlets in marginalized neighborhoods. Poor land use patterns and urban design have created the food deserts many poor people now live in. Better land use and urban design can retrofit these places into complete neighborhoods in which all populations have access to healthy food.

### Additional Strategies

* Plan complete neighborhoods with residences within walking distance of food sources and/or transit supportive densities.
* Align state and local grants and incentives with projects that support food access. For example, Smart Growth Districts, Priority Development Areas, MassWorks grants.
* For additional Land Use & Urban Design strategies, see the other chapters of the Healthy Community Design Toolkit
