When planning new communities, there are a number of things that should be considered to ensure that future residents will have access to food. In the planning phase, land should be set aside for community gardens and retail options. It is also important to make sure the zoning for the area does not prohibit these uses. Planning for a mix of residential uses at a density that creates the demand necessary to sustain a store should also be carefully considered. The development of a walkable neighborhood is also key. Streets in a neighborhood should be laid out in a connected way that allows people to take the shortest route possible to destinations if they choose to. Sidewalks and bike lanes \(where applicable\) should also be considered. Streets that have added bike lanes have seen a 23% increase in bicycle traffic and residents are up to 65% more likely to walk if their neighborhood has sidewalks . These improvements could make it more likely that people will walk or ride their bicycle to the store to buy food, especially if it is located within their neighborhood.

  
When a planned community will also have transit running throughout, siting of transit stops and the inclusion of transit supportive features are key. People are usually willing to walk ¼ mile to a bus stop and ½ mile to a light rail or streetcar stop. Ensuring that stops are no more than these distances from concentrated populations and food retail options along the route will make it more likely that people will be able and willing to take transit in order to gain access to food. Ensuring that the wait for transit is pleasant by including shelters to protect riders from the sun and rain, benches to sit and wait on, lighting to increase the perception of safety and trashcans to ensure that the area is well kept is also important. These small improvements paired with well planned routes and frequencies can make possible for people to use transit as a means for accessing food. These improvements can be planned in new communities and added into existing ones. Many communities in Massachusetts are already developed and will not be creating entirely new neighborhoods. This, however, does not mean that actions can’t be taken to ensure that the design of the current neighborhood cannot be modified to increase access to healthy foods. Underused or vacant parcels can be turned into community gardens or a staging area for a weekly farmer’s market. Active transportation infrastructure investments can be prioritized on streets that provide direct connections to food retailers or community farms. Existing neighborhoods could also be upzoned or accessory dwelling units could be permitted, and even incentivized, to help get the population density that is necessary to support transit investments or a full-sized grocery store.
