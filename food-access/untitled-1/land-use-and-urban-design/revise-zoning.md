Housing developers often do not consider the food growing needs of future building occupants. Open space requirements, particularly for multi-family housing, often result in fragmented remainders of space with little utility or unproductive ornamental landscaping. To maximize peoples’ ability to grow their own food, new residential development can require that site designs provide appropriate spaces for gardens. Requirements can specify a minimal required gardening space for each unit that receives adequate light, water and has appropriate soil conditions and establish mechanisms through which future residents will be guaranteed access and use of these spaces.

Model zoning language for home garden requirements: 

#### **Definitions**

 _Home Garden:_ an area of a single-family or multi-family residence used for the cultivation of fruits, vegetables, plants, flowers, or herbs by the residents of the property, guests of the property owner, or a gardening business hired by the property owner. Produce is grown \[primarily\] for personal consumption or donation. 

#### Use Table 

_Home Garden:_ permitted by right as an accessory use to all residential uses in \[all\] zoning districts. 

#### Home Garden Requirements: 

\[linked to the use table or bulk requirements, or included as a stand-alone general requirement, or within open space, landscaping or other suitable section.\] 

* All residential uses shall be provided with a minimum of 100 continuous square feet per dwelling unit available for use as a home garden. For multi-family uses, this area shall be marked and information on its use shall be provided to residents.
* Home garden space may be counted as part of required open space.
* Home gardens may be located in \[any\] required setback.
* Fences and structures are permitted as regulated in underlying zoning districts.
* Home garden space shall be have soil, water supply, and sunlight access conditions sufficient to support cultivation of typical home garden crops between typical frost-free periods. Garden space shall be of an appropriate slope.
* Home gardens shall be located, designed, and maintained so that water and fertilizer will not drain onto adjacent property.
* An area for composting of organic material produced in home gardens shall be designated. Compost materials shall be kept at least \[\_\_\_feet\] from inhabited structures and in a manner that controls odor, prevents infestation, and minimizes runoff into waterways and onto adjacent properties.

_\[Some communities may wish to explicitly enable home gardeners in certain districts to sell homegrown produce from their homes, perhaps limited to certain times or overall dollar amounts to ensure the activity is compatible with neighboring uses.\]_
