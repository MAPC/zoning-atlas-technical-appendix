# Municipal Plans, Policies, Programs & Systems

This category includes strategies that influence the “systems” of local government so that local governments act more consistently and effectively to facilitate healthy food access by their citizens. An array of plans, policies and structures can be harnessed to guide the workings of government toward ensuring food access for all. Where municipal plans generally describe what changes should occur, policies specify to how desired changes should happen. Where a plan might identify a goal to improve healthy food availability, for example, a policy that supports this goal could specify nutrition standards for food purchased or served by municipalities. This section also includes food access programs that either can benefit from the support of cities and towns, or can be undertaken directly by cities and towns—for example providing support for incentives programs for purchasing fruits and vegetables. Our research support the connection between government infrastructure committed to improving food access and improved health outcomes of affected residents.

Developing food systems in which people can reliably and affordably choose and eat a variety of healthy food options requires strategies that identify opportunities for immediate and long term change to occur. Working together, municipalities and advocates should develop long range plans and policies that guide food system changes that are integral to municipalities’ broader goals for community development.

Ensure those eligible for SNAP and other benefits can access screening and enrollment services. Municipalities can offer in-person screening and application assistance at senior centers and other municipal facilities. 

Massachusetts has several models that subsidize the cost of CSA shares for customers. This model reduces the price of fruits and vegetables \(different from incentives programs that increase the money available to customers for these purchases\). Typically coordinated by farms and community organizations, municipalities could look to existing subsidy models to develop their own. Grow Food Northampton offers ½ price CSA shares to SNAP recipients. Groundwork Lawrence’s Share-a-Share™ program subsidizes CSA shares, incentivizes farmers market purchases, and funds donations to food pantries.

**Plans and Policies**

Adopt a Right to Farm Bylaw

* Right to Farm Bylaws protect and encourage agriculture by allowing for agricultural activities and uses and protect against nuisance lawsuits with abutters and town agencies. These are non-binding bylaws that specify allowed agricultural activities, and are also useful in raising public awareness relative to local farming needs and values.
* Fact Sheet: [http://www.pvpc.org/sites/default/files/files/PVPC-Right%20to%20Farm%20Bylaws.pdf](http://www.pvpc.org/sites/default/files/files/PVPC-Right%20to%20Farm%20Bylaws.pdf)
