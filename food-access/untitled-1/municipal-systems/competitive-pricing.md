Competitive pricing is a strategy, which aims to make healthier foods more enticing to purchase through monetary incentivizes.  This competitive pricing can be done by lowering the cost of the healthy food and drink options or raising the cost of the unhealthy food and drink options. In some instances, places will raise the unhealthy food prices and use that profit margin to lower the healthier options, with the desired outcome of stabilizing profits. The goal of this strategy and the real benefit is the increased consumption of healthy foods. This strategy has been studied and has been found to be quite effective. Researchers found that teens and adults were more likely to buy the lower priced item no matter its nutritional contents\[1\]. There is also evidence that in some cases the healthy behaviors incentivized by these pricing schemes can have a sustained impact even when the pricing of the healthy food returns to its pre-study pricing\[2\].
