The strong connection between economic insecurity and food insecurity has been well established. Our recent review of scientific literature on the relationship between economic opportunity and food access documents increased negative health outcomes in food insecure households, including among children. At the same time, the research shows that neighborhoods with disproportionately high levels of poverty and food insecurity, that do house a range of food retail options, including full-line grocery stores and corner stores, and that are also walkable for the residents, and are well served by public transportation show higher rates of healthy food consumption.

Municipalities can address economic insecurity by bringing healthy food retail to under-served areas; by improving the range of healthy food available in existing retail outlets, by enabling individuals and groups to supplement their food resources by growing their own food, and by creating opportunities for income generation, as possible, and also by assuring that 100% of eligible families, especially older adults, are using their SNAP and other benefits.

Municipalities can play a significant role by pre-permitting land for grocery stores in under-served areas, providing tax incentives, waiving associated fees, and requiring developers to ensure walkability and transit accessibility. Many municipalities have programs to work with corner stores to include healthy food in their offerings.

Additional research focusing on interventions to support poor people in addressing their own food insecurity suggests the utility of community gardens. Municipalities can play a significant role in facilitating community gardens. The City of Springfield has a zoning ordinance enabling community groups to establish gardens on un-used available land. Municipalities can also foster urban agriculture by setting aside larger plots of city land for urban farms.

Cities and Towns across the country \(Chicago, Madison, Cleveland, San Diego\) and in MA \(Northampton, Holyoke, and others\) have changed their zoning regulations to remove barriers and/or facilitate urban agriculture, including in some case raising chickens and bees and other small livestock. Chicago requires rooftop gardens on some developments and Portland incentivizes rooftop gardens with a ‘bonus floor’.

Municipalities can also assure that farmer’s markets accept SNAP and WIC.
