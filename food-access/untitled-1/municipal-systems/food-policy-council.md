**Food Policy Councils\[1\]** \(FPCs\) are comprised of individuals from all aspects of a local food system. They are often officially sanctioned through a government action such as a SelectBoard or City Council motion or they can also be a grassroots effort. A Food Policy Council is an inter-disciplinary collaboration between citizens, advocacy organizations and community based groups and government officials. The goal is to assess and understand the food issues and goals of the community and to provide a forum for advocacy and policy development that works towards the creation of a food system that is ecologically sustainable, economically viable and socially just, seeking to assure equitable food access and promote public health.

A food policy is any decision, regulation, program or project that is endorsed by a government agency, business, or organization which effects how food is produced, processed, distributed, purchased, protected and disposed. Food policy operates at the global, national, provincial, regional, local and institutional levels. World Trade Organization regulations, welfare policies, farm subsidies and labeling standards are some examples of higher level polices that influence the food system.

At the local and municipal level, examples of food policies include:

* The regulatory requirements placed on someone planning to open a food-based business;
* Food purchasing decisions of institutional buyers and how they relate to the use of locally produced items;
* A decision by school officials on whether or not to allow junk food and soft drinks in the vending machines;
* The child nutrition requirements placed on daycares that receive municipal funding.

Many municipalities in MA have food policy councils. A sampling of municipal websites is included below. You are encouraged to contact \(email or call\) the people identified on these websites for guidance as you move forward with your work. You can also always contact your regional planning agency \(RPA-link to contact map website\) for direction on any topic including food policy, as well as Halley Reeves and Kim Etingoff at MA DPH \(contact info\). The staff to the MA Food Policy Council is also an excellent resource in starting a local FPC, as are any of the members of the MAFPC steering committee \(link to website\)
