Municipal plans establish a vision for a community’s future. Integrating food goals and policies into municipal planning documents reinforces the connections of food system in conventionally addressed topics such as land use, transportation, housing, economic development, and environmental and human health elements. Where food policies are woven throughout such documents, these policies and a vision for improved food systems can be advanced as part of long term strategic community development plans. Master \(or comprehensive\) plans cover a wide range of topics that cut across many government functions and departments; including food system goals in a master plan, as well as supportive language in the plan’s overarching vision and objectives can help to ensure consideration of and action on food related goals and policies. Food goals and policies may also be integrated into other plans such as open space and recreation plans, transportation plans, or neighborhood development plans.`[5]` As communities develop plans on emergent topics, such as climate plans, they should integrate food security and related goals. Food goals can be included in several areas within municipal plans including the following:`[6]`

* **Vision Statement**: Language on improving access to healthy foods or other overarching food goals can be included here.
* **Land Use Component**: Land use strategies, particularly in urban areas should promote density and walkability, and thereby increase access to community services and features, such as food retail locations.
* **Circulation and Transportation Component**: This component should accommodate multimodal transportation that enables ease of movement and accessing community services and features, such as food pantries.
* **Housing Component**: This component should support affordable housing, and can promote affordable food access goals.
* **Parks and Recreation Component**: Community gardens and urban farm goals can be included in this component.
* **Public Facilities and Services Component**: This component can promote joint use agreements for kitchens in schools or other municipal buildings.

Including food goals and policies into municipal plans should also include a review of current municipal policies to identify where existing policies can more explicitly align with a food system vision, and remove unintended impediments.`[7]`

#### **Master Plan - Boxborough**: [Boxborough 2030](http://www.boxborough-ma.gov/boxborough2030), A Rural, Engaged Community for All

Boxborough’s master plan, adopted in January 2016 lays out a long term vision for the town that reads: “Boxborough shall maintain its traditional values of rural open space, a first-rate educational system, agricultural and conservation lands, and historical roots while fostering a balanced economic environment and enhancing a close knit sense of community for all generations.” The vision statement explicitly identifies agriculture as a community value, and the plan lays out aspirations, goals, strategies, and action steps for ensuring agricultural preservation. Specific town entities are identified as responsible for leading efforts on these actions. Following are the food related elements in the plan:

_Aspiration: Is thoughtfully developed: …The community’s agricultural assets will be leveraged for economic development and to enhance quality of life…_

#### **Master Plan – Hudson:** [Hudson Master Plan, 2014](https://www.vhb.com/Documents/Hudson%20Master%20Plan_final_November%202014.pdf)

In its recently completed master plan, Hudson includes a section on public health, with an assessment and recommendations for food access in the community.

**Plan excerpt: Public Health Needs: Healthy Food Access:**

Hudson is well-served by five supermarkets in Hudson, including BJ’s Wholesale Club, Hannaford Supermarket, Super Stop & Shop, Wal-Mart Supercenter, and Market Basket. These grocery stores provide affordable and healthy food options to the community. Supplementing these stores at the neighborhood level with additional smaller scale food entities that also sell local, affordable, and healthy food products would improve the Town’s food access. The community garden and food pantry provides an additional resource. Neighborhood level stores within walking distance of most Hudson residents would fill in any future food system holes. Access to local, healthy, and affordable food for everyone is key in developing a sustainable food system and addressing public health concerns related to food access. Currently, there are no farmers markets in Hudson. Establishing community supported agriculture \(CSA\) programs and weekly farmers markets during the growing season are another step Hudson can take towards improving the community’s food system.

**Plan excerpt: Goals and Strategies:**

Goal 3: Improve pedestrian amenities to encourage walking, running, bicycling, and public transit.

* SSPH-14. Incorporate healthy community design into Hudson’s planning process in order to make healthy choices easier for the Town’s residents. The concept of healthy community design links the traditional planning concepts including land use, transportation, community facilities, parks, and open space with health themes such as physical activity, public safety, healthy food access, mental health, air and water quality, and social equity issues.  ****Responsible parties: Town Planning Board, Board of Health

Goal 4: Develop additional programming and tasks related to public health and social services.

* SSPH-16. Educate Hudson residents of the importance of public health and its issues related to food access, transportation, and tobacco use through school programs, informational brochures, community workshops, mailing flyers, and through electronic media. Responsible Party: Board of Health
