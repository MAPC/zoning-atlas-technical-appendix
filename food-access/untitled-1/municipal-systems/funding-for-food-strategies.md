We assume readers will interpret this topic as securing funding for your work, which is accurate, but we also understand this topic to include the need to identify, lift up, and facilitate access to, direct funding assistance available to families and individuals, such as SNAP, WIC, EITC, etc\[1\] Across the country, 17% of eligible families are not receiving their benefits and nearly six out of ten elderly persons are not receiving their SNAP benefits.\[2\]

President Obama, supported by First Lady Michelle Obama’s signature Let’s Move campaign, launched the Healthy Food Financing Initiative \(HFFI\) in 2011 with funding awards administered through the US DHHS, Community Economic Development HFFI, website: [https://ami.grantsolutions.gov/view/HHS-2014-ACF-OCS-EE-0819](https://ami.grantsolutions.gov/view/HHS-2014-ACF-OCS-EE-0819)

PolicyLink and the Food Trust \(based out of Philadelphia\) created this website resource center: [http://www.healthyfoodaccess.org/funding/available-funding](http://www.healthyfoodaccess.org/funding/available-funding) in 2013 to publicize funding opportunities to promote healthy food access. The website includes an inventory of funding available at all levels of government as well as the private sector.

The proposed Massachusetts Food Trust has recently advanced out of the Senate--amendment \#666 by Senator Moore for dedicated funding at $500,000 to spur economic development, create jobs, and increase access to healthy, affordable foods in low and moderate income communities.

A number of foundations are funding local food access work in MA including but not limited to: the Barr Foundation, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Kraft Foods, and the Kresge Foundation.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health Mass in Motion initiative is funding food access work in 65 municipalities across the Commonwealth, including enhanced efforts in four initiatives in Fall River, Springfield, Franklin County and a subset of communities in Hampshire County. Many of these initiatives receive supplemental funding from local foundations, chambers of commerce, local hospitals community benefit funds, and other sources to advance food access work.

The Massachusetts Community Compact elevates the Administration’s partnerships with cities and towns, and allows the Governor’s Office to work more closely with leaders from all municipalities. The Cabinet champions municipal interests across all executive secretariats and agencies, and develops, in consultation with cities and towns, mutual standards and best practices for both the state and municipalities.  The creation of Community Compacts creates clear standards, expectations and accountability for both partners. As Governor Baker said when signing the Executive Order, the Community Compact Cabinet “gives cities and towns a real seat at the table” in the Baker-Polito Administration. It includes the option to work to promote local land protection and to promote local agriculture.
