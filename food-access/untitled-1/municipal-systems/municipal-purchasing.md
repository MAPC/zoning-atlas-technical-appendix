Municipal food procurement policies that encourage healthy and local food purchases by public institutions, such as schools, councils on aging, and municipal offices can ensure meals offered to students, elder residents, city staff and others are nutritious, and can also support local agriculture. Communities can focus on two policy areas that establish standards for healthy food procurement: establishing nutrition standards and increasing local food purchases.

Municipal food procurement policies that encourage healthy and local food purchases by public institutions, such as schools, councils on aging, and municipal offices can ensure meals offered to students, elder residents, city staff and others are nutritious, and can also support local agriculture. Communities can focus on two policy areas that establish standards for healthy food procurement: establishing nutrition standards and increasing local food purchases.

**Healthy food procurement policy:**

Municipalities can support community healthy by establishing nutrition standards in their procurement policies. Implementing policies that restrict calories, fat, trans fat, sugar or sodium can facilitate building healthier food environments, drive the reformulation of foods, and improve diets for diverse settings.\[1\] On a municipal level, these settings could include schools, senior centers, community centers, and other places meals are served through local programs and funding. As a part of developing health food procurement policies, municipalities can support a culture of health by ensuring nutritious foods are served at municipally-sponsored meetings, conferences, and community events.  

{% hint style="info" %}
The **City of Boston**’s executive order sets beverage nutrition standards, and prevents the sale of high sugar beverages for cafeterias, vending machines, concession stands, meetings, programs, and events where these purchases are made with City funds. See below for the language of the executive order.
{% endhint %}

**Local food procurement policy:**

Schools, hospitals, universities and other large food purchasers are leading the way in Massachusetts in purchasing food from local farmers, fishermen, and other food producers.\[2\] Municipalities have the opportunity to follow on these successes in their communities. Where policies support purchasing local foods, particularly fruits and vegetables, they also support more communities in eating more nutritious diets. Local food purchasing also benefits the local economy, and where money goes to local farms, it is also circulated locally.\[3\] 

Efforts to develop municipal food procurement policies must take the funding source into consideration, as the guidelines and requirements vary depending on whether the funds are from federal or state sources. Programs like the federally-funded National School Lunch Program, are authorized under federal law to specify a preference for local food purchasing.\[4\] Massachusetts law \(Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 7, § 23B\) asserts that State institutions ‘shall’ purchase local foods, allowing them to spend up to ten percent more for local foods.\[5\] On a local level, municipalities have the flexibility to apply the state’s price preference for in-state products,\[6\] or develop their own food purchasing policies that use local funds. In all procurement efforts, municipalities may also partner with others on collective purchasing initiatives to leverage economies of scale of larger food purchases. Municipalities should also consider how and whether to ensure compliance with local food procurement policies.

**Procurement models:**

The following models can be applied by municipalities and advocates to encourage local or healthy food procurement by municipalities. These come from the PolicyLink toolkit, linked below:

* _The Contract Model: In this scenario, a public agency, institution, or set of institutions contract out to external suppliers. This process usually takes on the form of a request for proposal \(RFP\) or invitation for bid \(IFB\) that is reliant upon a guiding set of principles for proposals and for the review process._
* _The Permit Model: In this scenario, a healthy food retailer serving in official public spaces \(municipal buildings, public parks, recreation centers\) requires a permit._
* _The Grant Model: Here, a public agency or institution providing financial support or resources to a non-governmental organization \(NGO\) or non-profit entity stipulates in the contract what types of food purchases can be made with these financial resources. Advocates and stakeholders should identify the large institutional purchasers in their city, state, or region and determine the types of procurement models used by those institutions._

{% hint style="info" %}
The exemplary **Los Angeles’ Good Food Purchasing Pledge** is a model municipal food resolution that establishes guidelines and criteria for food procurement. This resolution specifies standards for institutional food purchases including local food purchasing, nutrition, and the workforce. Participating public institutions in LA serve nearly 660,000 meals combined, and directing over $12 million in produce purchases into the local economy.\[7\]
