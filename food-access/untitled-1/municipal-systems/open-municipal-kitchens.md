Joint \(or Community\) Use Agreements are formal agreements that allow for shared use of property or facilities.

These agreements are particularly useful for neighborhoods that have limited access to community recreational or other facilities as they increase the number of facilities that are available to be physically active.

**Walpole Community Test Kitchen**

Determined to help residents in the town develop healthier lifestyles, the Board of Health in partnership with the School Nutrition Director collaborated on the joint-use of Walpole School District’s kitchen facilities for the purpose of developing community youth and family culinary and nutrition education programming.

The focus group reviewed the lessons, length of classes, obstacles in reaching out to people, fees, and publicity. After the kitchen program concept was positively received by the community, the team developed the joint use agreement with School Administration.  Once the agreement was approved by the school’s legal counsel, the kitchen programming began in September 2015 and has operated successfully.
