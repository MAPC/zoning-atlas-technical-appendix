Financial incentives for purchasing fruits and vegetables encourage healthier eating, and increase the purchasing power of customers with otherwise restricted incomes. Program are typically intended to increase the buying power of low income individuals who are likelier to experience food insecurity. A common model applies incentives when SNAP benefits are redeemed, and customers receive either an additional $.30 to $1.00 for every SNAP dollar spent.

Massachusetts has several examples of successful incentives programs for purchasing healthy foods. Recognized nationally as one of the most successful programs, the Healthy Incentives Pilot \(HIP\) was completed in 2013 in Hampden County. HIP offered SNAP recipients an incentive of $.30 for every $1.00 of SNAP benefits spent on fruits and vegetables at participating grocery and convenience stores, farmers markets and farm stands. Evaluation of the project found that “HIP participants consumed almost one-quarter cup \(26%\) more targeted fruits and vegetables each day than did non-HIP respondents”. This finding was both statistically significant and nutritionally relevant. Participants also shared that the program enabled them to buy a wider variety of produce than they may have otherwise and found the produce to be more affordable.

Building on the success of the Pilot, Massachusetts is now expanding the incentives model statewide. In leveraging a $3.4 million USDA Food insecurity Nutrition Incentive \(FINI\) grant, and matching state and community partner funds, the Healthy Incentives Program \(FINI-HIP\) will provide $1.00 for every $1.00 of SNAP benefits spent on fruits and vegetables at four retail types: farmers markets, farm stands, mobile markets, CSAs, as well as the Boston Public Market. The five-year program is in its planning stages now, and beginning in April 2017 through March 2020 SNAP customers will receive the incentive match when purchasing fruits and vegetables from participating and eligible retailers.

Started in 2007, Boston Bounty Bucks \(BBB\) was one of the first farmers market incentive programs in the country. Funded through a combination of FINI grants and Boston’s annual BostonCANshare campaign, the BBB program doubles purchases of fruit and vegetable with SNAP benefits up to $10. Since its inceptions the program has increased 74-fold, and in 2014 nearly $200,000 were distributed. 

The Pittsfield Farmers Market Double Value Program\[1\] started in 2015 and extends 100% purchasing incentives for customers using SNAP, WIC, and Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program benefits. Incentives can be applied weekly up to $20 of purchases that comply with benefit restrictions. In the first program year, the farmer’s market was able to double $10,000 in SNAP purchases, benefitting customers and local farmers. The Double Value program is funded through local business sponsorships and small grants. In exchange for the monetary sponsorships, local businesses are recognized online, at the farmer’s market and in marketing materials.

Beginning in April 2017 the FINI-HIP incentives will be available statewide for SNAP recipients at participating farmers markets, farm stands, mobile markets, CSAs and the Boston Public Market. Municipalities may consider ways in which they can develop complementary incentives programs that extend to customers receiving a range of benefits, and to retailers that are currently not eligible for FINI-HIP incentives.
