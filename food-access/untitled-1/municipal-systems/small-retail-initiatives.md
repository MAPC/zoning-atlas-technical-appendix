Small retail stores in low-income communities have long been a central conundrum in efforts to improve healthy food access. They often stock the non-perishable, processed, convenience foods that characterize our broken food system, and contribute to negative health outcomes. They’re also often owned by residents, employ local residents, buy from other local businesses and are patronized by their neighbors, all enormously positive features of a healthy community.

Across the county and in Massachusetts, “cornerstore conversion” efforts have had mixed results. Where one study on economic impact of the Philadelphia Healthy Corner Store Network estimated that it supported 38 jobs, $1.1 million in earnings and $140,000 in additional tax revenue in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania during one 30-month period,\[1\] several efforts have not been so successful. Frequently the case, store owners who want to respond to customer demand for healthier products come up against a wide variety of obstacles in doing so: sourcing, infrastructure, marketing, and others. Even when they surmount those, small retailers don’t always find stocking healthy food to be good business. The most successful efforts engage the talents and support of community and business development experts. Municipal partners, including boards of health, and economic and community development departments are important actors in successful efforts to improve the food environment through healthy food efforts in small retail settings. Where municipal partners can help deliver technical assistance, connect stores to needed resources, and provide oversight, these efforts can be a win for businesses and the community.
