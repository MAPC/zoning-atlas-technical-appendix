# Transportation

Transportation plays a significant role affecting families’ ability to access healthy food. It is the whole transportation system that matters, but especially whether or not there is regular, reliable, affordable public transportation \(especially in neighborhoods with high concentrations of poverty and households living without access to a car\), how many people lack access to a car \(and whether or not there is access to car-sharing services such as zip car\), and whether or not the built environment is safe and comfortable for walking and/or bicycling to food retail outlets \(and whether or not there is a bike share system made affordable to economically disadvantaged households\).\[1\]

A study\[2\] by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that 2.2 % of all households or approximately 2.3 million households in the U.S. live more than a mile from a supermarket and do not have access to a car. An additional 3.2% of households \(3.4 million\) live between one-half and one-mile from a grocery store and do not have access to a car.

Developing new food outlets in communities with poor access to food is often difficult because that often relies on action from the private sector. Municipalities can, however, take action to strengthen the transportation system leading to and from existing food infrastructure.

Many supermarkets are currently sited on major arterial roads that move large numbers of cars at fast speeds. These roads can be both unpleasant and dangerous to walk alongside or ride a bicycle on. A range of built environment strategies to enhance active transportation will also improve food access.\[3\] Complete Street improvements—that help to slow traffic on these roads, while also providing space for bicyclists and pedestrians—should be prioritized in locations with significant gaps or barriers between residential neighborhoods and shopping outlets that have healthy food. Car-sharing and bike-share systems should also be encouraged.

The average grocery shopping trip takes place at supermarket approximately 3 miles from where the shopper lives\[4\] and the average transit trip for bus, light rail and street car is under five miles.\[5\] Additionally 30% of those that are food-insecure do not own their own vehicle. Prioritizing new transit routes and improvements in frequencies along routes that connect residential areas to food outlets is crucial to ensuring that these food-insecure populations can obtain fresh foods. Reevaluating on-board transit policies that restrict the number of bags or the use of a small folding cart, should also be evaluated to ensure that they are not prohibiting transit as a mode of travel to get food. In Massachusetts,  Metropolitan Planning Organizations \(MPOs\) develop the annual budgets for transportation expenditures in each region of the Commonwealth.\[6\] Communities are represented by the MPO in a variety of formats.

Ensuring that people do not have to rely on a private vehicles to get to a grocery store, by making the pedestrian and bicycle environment more friendly and by ensuring that transit is both convenient and affordable can have positive impacts beyond increasing access to fresh food by also increasing levels of active transportation which has been linked with positive health outcomes.

An MPO is a regional transportation policy-making organization consisting of representatives from local government, regional transit operators, and state transportation agencies. Federal legislation passed in the early 1970s required the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area with a population greater than 50,000.

{% tab title="Additional Strategies" %}
* Prioritize food access when planning and building Complete Streets. Streets that link dense neighborhoods to daily essentials like grocery stores should be prioritized for multi-modal improvements.
* Prioritize food access when making improvements to transit systems.
* Eliminate restrictions on number of grocery bags that can be carried on transit.
* Expand transit access across Massachusetts, especially in areas not served by the MBTA.
