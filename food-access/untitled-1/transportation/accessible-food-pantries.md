Food pantries are one important source of emergency food for residents experiencing food shortages. In many municipalities, particularly rural or suburban areas with limited transit options, pantries may be located in areas that are not easily accessible for residents. Food systems advocates and municipal officials can consider working with their regional transit authorities to add transit stops or bus lines to difficult to access food pantries. They can also work with organizations considering establishing food pantries and use GIS and mapping tools to strategically site pantries in locations that are more easily accessible for residents. Municipalities can also assess conditions around current pantries and prioritize changes to the built environment such as the addition or repair of sidewalks or the feasibility of adding bike lanes to the area. Food system advocates and municipalities can also consider working with entities to establish mobile food pantries including addressing any regulatory barriers that permit the establishment and use of mobile food trucks.
