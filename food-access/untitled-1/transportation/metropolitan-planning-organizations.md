As noted above, a Metropolitan Planning Organization \(MPO\) is a regional transportation policy-making organization consisting of representatives from local government, regional transit operators, and state transportation agencies.  Federal legislation passed in the early 1970s required the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area with a population greater than 50,000.  In Massachusetts, the 13 MPOs are staffed by the 13 Regional Planning Agencies \(RPAs\) in the Commonwealth.\[1\] Each MPO is empowered by federal legislation, rules and guidance to establish a system for ranking proposed transportation projects in the region. These ‘ranking systems’ can include consideration of food access. The Nashville MPO was recognized in 2012 as a leader integrating public health into their MPO decision-making process. From 2014-2016 the Kresge Foundation funded a 2-year initiative, "Planning for a Healthier Future Collaborative", including the Nashville MPO and Seattle WA, Portland OR and San Diego CA \(as well as some examples from the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments\)\[2\] to "summarize best practices in the development of health, equity and environmental measures that can be used to evaluate the performance of transportation investments at a regional scale."\[3\]

Food access is not a major focus of this work, but it does come up in the category of "Access to opportunities" as well as in the emphasis on preserving agricultural lands. The integration of health considerations is more about balancing walking and bicycling with motorized modes and with respect to food access, the work factors in agricultural land lost or potentially lost in transportation development projects. There is a focus on "Access to Opportunities", which emphasizes access to jobs, and does include a category "Access to Other Opportunities" which is defined as: "Household access to grocery stores, healthcare facilities, and parks/recreation facilities by each mode within a set amount of time." \[1\] The report identifies the Puget Sound Regional Council \(PSRC\) and SEMCOG as resources for more information on factoring food access into MPO work. In MA, both the PVPC and MAPC are factoring health into their ranking procedure. In the Pioneer Valley, food access is not specifically called out, but it could be ‘written in’. MAPC emphasizes the importance of a variety of transportation options, including active transportation options like walking and biking, and the potential for transportation modes to improve access to services, jobs, and other opportunities.
