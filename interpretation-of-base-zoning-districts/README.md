# Interpretation of Base Zoning Districts

For the base zoning districts in the Zoning Atlas, MAPC defined a basic set of “core fields” covering use allowances and dimensional requirements to populate. The core fields are as follows: 

* Minimum lot size 
* Dwelling units allowed per acre 
* Maximum height 
* Maximum floor-area-ratio \(FAR\)  
* Whether multifamily housing was a permitted use, and if a special permit was required  

The values in the Zoning Atlas for these fields generally reflect the by-right regulations of a zone as they appeared in the bylaw or ordinance on the date it was accessed by MAPC. The exception to this rule is the four multifamily fields \(`MULFAM2`, `MULFAM3_4`, `MULFAM5_19`and `MULFAM20_`\), which capture uses allowed by special permit, in addition to those allowed by-right.
