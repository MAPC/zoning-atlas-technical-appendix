# Green and Fit Buildings

By designing buildings that take into consideration the health of people who use those buildings, everyday activities become healthier activities. Green buildings address occupant health as well as larger community and environmental impacts. For example, indoor air quality can be improved by using low-VOC \(volatile organic compound\) paints and adhesives during construction, and by ensuring good ventilation while the building is in use. Green buildings are also often sited in smart growth locations within walking distance of multiple destination resources.

Overall, green buildings reduce environmental impacts, and some of these measures directly augment the ability of local residents to maintain an active lifestyle. For example, better stormwater management improves the quality of nearby rivers and other water bodies that are used for recreation purposes.`83` Another example is the use of light-colored roofs and pavements, both of which reduce urban heat island effects and smog formation \(harmful gasses and particulates in the air\), making developed areas more comfortable for physical activity \(though decreased outdoor temperatures in summer\) and improving local air quality.

### **Principles of Universal Design:**

* **PRINCIPLE ONE: Equitable Use** The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.Take advantage of compact building design;
* **PRINCIPLE TWO: Flexibility in Use** Create walkable neighborhoods;
* **PRINCIPLE THREE: Simple and Intuitive Use** Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. Preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical resources;
* **PRINCIPLE FOUR: Perceptible Information** The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.
* **PRINCIPLE FIVE: Tolerance for Error** The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.
* **PRINCIPLE SIX: Low Physical Effort** The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.
* **PRINCIPLE SEVEN: Size and Space for Approach and Use** Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.

Designing a building to be a fit building, or to promote physical activity as part of the daily behavior of occupants, also has lasting health impacts. For example, a building’s design can

increase stair use by locating the stairs prominently by the entrance while placing elevators out of direct sight. Another example gives employees the option to use standing workstations in place of desks in an effort to combat the harmful health effects of sitting all day \(including increased blood pressure and cholesterol levels`84`\).

Local actions promoting green and fit buildings are limited by the requirement for the Building Code to be uniform statewide. The state establishes the Building Code, and municipalities cannot make changes to it that would apply only locally.

_**Fit Buildings**_, also called Active Buildings, are buildings that promote physical activity as part of the daily behavior of occupants. For example, fit buildings can include designs that promote use of stairs over elevators.

_**Green Buildings**_ ****are designed, built and operated in a manner that is environmentally responsible and resource efficient. Green buildings address energy efficiency, occupant health, waste reduction, materials production, and other relevant issues.

_**Green Roofs**_ ****incorporate soil and vegetation into a structure’s rooftop system. These systems can range from thin soils with moss up to thick soils capable of supporting micro- farms. The main benefits of green roofs are enhanced stormwater management, insulating properties, and UV protection for roof membranes.

_**Smart Growth**_ to development that is concentrated in and around downtowns, village centers, transit stops, or other infrastructure that provides convenient access to goods and services without relying on use of automobiles. Smart Growth is characterized by mixed-use downtowns and neighborhoods, diverse housing options and increased walkability. This compact development pattern protects open space and farmland, revitalizes downtowns, supports affordable housing options, and provides more transportation choices by directing growth to locations where higher densities can be supported.

_**Urban Heat Island Effects**_ ****occur when pavement and buildings absorb solar energy throughout the day and radiate that heat back into the air. This is due to pavement, buildings and other structures absorbing more heat from sunlight than the natural landscape. For example, this can cause the ambient temperature of a city of one million people to be 2-5°F hotter during the day and up to 22°F hotter at night than a rural location in the same area.`82`
