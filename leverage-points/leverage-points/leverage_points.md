  Community Plans set long-term goals and guide decision-making. The most widely
  used plans are Master Plans and Open Space and Recreation Plans.

# Community Plans

Because a Master Plan is a document that establishes a vision for the future, it can be a very powerful tool in shaping the future health of a community. A Master Plan can respond to changing demographics \(e.g. increases in senior citizen populations with lower rates of automobile use\), and can promote healthy community strategies such as protection or creation of open space, zoning regulations that increase walkability, and transportation network improvements. Healthy community principles can be incorporated throughout a Master Plan that is under development, or if a community’s Master Plan is reasonably up to date, a standalone community health chapter can be appended to the existing Master Plan. However, it is preferable to include applicable healthy community principles in each chapter of a Master Plan.

Almost all municipalities have a Master Plan, but the frequency with which they are updated can vary widely. A Master Plan does not have to be updated all at once. Adopting a single chapter at a time can be a viable way to improve a plan. Depending on how the plan is organized, another option is to take a neighborhood by neighborhood approach.

An Open Space and Recreation Plan \(OSRP\) addresses preservation and development of open space, greenways, playgrounds and ball fields. The OSRP can provide guidance in protecting water supplies and open spaces, connecting different greenspaces to each other, or connecting trails and paths to create a more cohesive network. In addition to its planning purposes, a Commonwealth-approved OSRP makes a community eligible for grants from the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs \(e.g. Land and Water Conservation Funds\).

In addition to Master Plans and Open Space and Recreation Plans, there are a wide variety of additional plans that communities adopt, including greenway plans, bike and pedestrian plans, and plans that focus on a specific area of a city. Only Master Plans and OSRPs are included in the Community Plans Checklist below. Most if not all community planning processes have a large public outreach component. This provides advocates of particular issues with an opportunity to publically discuss and build support for their ideas within the community.

{% tab title="Definitions" %}
_**Complete Streets**_ ****are roads that are designed for all modes of transit, including vehicles, public transportation, biking and walking, and people of all abilities. Design considerations include bike or bus lanes, road narrowing, sidewalks, crosswalks, and facilities such as covered bus stops or bicycle parking.

_**Infill Developments**_ ****are projects in already developed areas that “fill in” vacant lots \(e.g. between existing buildings\). Infill most commonly happens in downtown areas and is designed to increase density to create a more walkable and more aesthetically uniform streetscape.

_**Master Plans**_ ****and _**Community Development Plans**_ are community- wide, action-oriented plans designed to achieve a shared community vision. A Master Plan establishes future goals in areas such as land use, transportation, housing and economic development.

_**Smart Growth**_ ****refers to development that is concentrated in and around downtowns, village centers, transit stops, or other infrastructure that provides convenient access to goods and services without relying on use of automobiles. Smart Growth is characterized by mixed-use downtowns and neighborhoods, diverse housing options and increased walkability. This compact development pattern protects open space and farmland, revitalizes downtowns, supports affordable housing options, and provides more transportation choices by directing growth to locations where higher densities can be supported.

_**Universal Design**_ incorporates the needs of everyone, including the older adults and people with disabilities, into a design to allow its use by the greatest number of people regardless of age or ability.

#### _**Master Plan**_

* [ ] Ensure that a health advocate serves on the Master Plan committee.
* [ ] Ensure that older adults are included on the Master Plan committee.
* [ ] Require a public health component in each of the Master Plan chapters.
* [ ] Housing
  * Encourage siting of housing developments within walking distance of parks, schools, jobs, and shopping.
  * Establish zoning regulations that allow for a variety of housing types at densities that support walkable commercial services and transit.
  * Allow higher density development around transit stops.
  * Encourage affordable and senior housing projects to include access \(by foot or transit\) to public parks, fitness opportunities, and healthy food shopping.
* [ ] Transportation and Circulation
  * Promote development of interconnected bike lanes, multi-use paths and sidewalk networks.
  * Address sidewalk maintenance and snow clearing.
  * Ensure that different transit options connect to each other.
  * Plan for streets to be brought up to Complete Streets standards.
  * Assess the location of transit routes and stops.
  * Ensure universal design at transit stops.
  * Accommodate bikes on public transit.
  * Promote traffic calming and enhanced intersection design for pedestrian safety.
* [ ] Open Space and Recreation
  * Promote the development of interconnected pathway networks.
  * Develop recreational opportunities near underserved neighborhoods.
  * Acquire new public open spaces and maintain existing open spaces.
  * Create community gardens in parks.
* [ ] Education
  * Develop a Safe Routes to School program.
  * Site educational facilities centrally within walking distance of residential populations and transit options.

* [ ] Land Use
  * Revise zoning regulations to promote compact, walkable smart growth development.
  * Encourage the establishment of community gardens.
  * Allow/encourage infill, cluster and mixed-use development.
  * Reduce setbacks in zoning regulations to bring buildings closer to the street.

  * Encourage integration of fitness opportunities for employees and customers.
  * Economic Development
    * Encourage mixed-use developments over single-use commercial developments to increase density and pedestrian traffic.
    * Provide public transportation options to large commercial and industrial areas.
    * Enable and encourage commercial agriculture.
* [ ] Natural and Cultural Resources
  * Develop a walking or biking tour of cultural and historic sites.
  * Services and Facilities
    * Locate or consolidate municipal facilities in town and city centers to increase walking and biking access.
  * Include a Food/Food Systems Chapter

    * Leverage Agricultural Preservation Restrictions \(APR\) to protect farmland and local food sources.
    * Create community gardens.
    * Ensure universal access to healthy food.
    * Promote urban agriculture.

#### _Open Space and Recreation Plan \(OSRP\)_

* [ ] Require a public health advocate to serve on the OSRP committee.
* [ ] Require that older adults serve on the OSRP committee.
* [ ] Acquire conservation lands and develop hiking trails, focusing on efforts near existing open space and trails, as well as underserved neighborhoods and other residential populations.
* [ ] Develop new and improve existing parks and playgrounds, focusing on efforts near underserved neighborhoods and other residential populations.
  * Create community gardens in parks.
* [ ] Plan an interconnected system of accessible open spaces. Ensure that open spaces are connected to multiple modes of transportation and are easily accessed by all residents.
* [ ] Develop bike paths and greenways that connect to the larger community, and install bicycle parking facilities at open space locations and transit hubs.
* [ ] Build and maintain sidewalk networks, and ensure that they connect to the larger community, including community open spaces.
* [ ] Adopt the Community Preservation Act to help fund open space and recreation enhancements.
* [ ] Protect areas of the community that are important to flood and stormwater management.
