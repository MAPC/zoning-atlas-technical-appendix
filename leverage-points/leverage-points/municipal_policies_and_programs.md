# Municipal Policies and Programs

Municipalities must lead by example, and municipal policies and programs can have a very real effect on the health of a community. These strategies address siting of schools and municipal buildings, developing programs that promote healthy activities, and incorporating healthy community ideas into everyday municipal decisions.

The siting of municipal facilities including COAs and Senior Centers and schools in accessible, smart growth locations that can be reached with existing walking, biking and public transit options can go a long way to promote more walking and biking. For example, a school sited at the edge of a community may only be reachable without a car by a select few who live in that part of town. In comparison, a school located in the heart of downtown neighborhood allows many more students and staff to walk or bike to school. According to MassRIDES, in 1963 roughly 48 percent of children walked or biked to school.86 Today that number is 13 percent, and travel to school may account for 25 percent of all morning traffic. The Federal Highway Administration points to the dangers of traffic as one of the largest reasons that parents do not allow their children to walk to school.87

Programs that attempt to overcome this barrier and actively promote walking and biking to school include Safe Routes to School and Walking School Busses or Bicycle Trains. In addition, by getting some students to walk and bike to school rather than being dropped off by cars, these programs also reduce traffic around schools, further increasing safety for students and increasing parent comfort levels with allowing their children to walk to school.

Municipal programs can also incentivize walking, biking and public transit use by municipal employees. Meanwhile, a robust network of Complete Streets promotes active lifestyles while ensuring that everyone can safely travel to where they need to go.`88`

**Focus on Aging: Older adults are a key leverage point**

Older adults are an important civic resource for all communities. Their energy, wisdom and effort help to keep our communities running. Older adults play an active role in community politics, by voting89, promoting candidates for election, or serving as selectmen or city councilors. Many older adults also sit on the boards and committees that have a direct influence of community planning and design, like the planning board, or zoning board of appeals. Older adults’s high participation rates in community processes gives them strong influence over community design. Often, for example, key decisions about a new land use regulation or a development project are made by older adults who hold positions of power and influence. Therefore, the opinions, beliefs and actions of older adults are a key leverage point for promoting healthy community design and planning. Luckily, “what is good for older adults is often good for everyone else,” so older adults can act in their own self-interest—by advocating for community design that meet their own needs—and they will simultaneously improve the quality of life for everyone.

Although older adults as a whole have a high rate of civic participation, there may be some barriers to full participation in municipal processes for some older. They may be unable to attend meetings due to mobility limitations, or unable to participate meaningfully in public meetings due to vision or hearing impairments. Public health and aging network professionals are natural advocates for the needs of these underserved older adults. At the same time, everyone involved in coordinating public meetings and processes needs to work to eliminate barriers to participation. Best practices include, holding meetings in accessible locations that are served by a wide range of transportation options, making sure the meeting room itself is easy to find within a building, holding meetings at a range of times and days of the week to meet the needs of a wide-range of participants, ensuring that meetings are held in locations with convenient bathrooms, and preparing graphics and handouts with legible type and graphics \(e.g. large, simple fonts and high contrast graphics\), and providing microphones at meetings to ensure that everyone can hear and be heard.

_**Complete Streets**_ are roads that are designed for all modes of transit, including vehicles, public transportation, biking and walking, and people of all abilities. Design considerations include bike or bus lanes, road narrowing, sidewalks, crosswalks, and facilities such as covered bus stops or bicycle parking.

_**Green Infrastructure**_ consists of natural or engineered systems \(including rain gardens, bioswales, green roofs and cisterns\) that capture and control stormwater near to where it falls. In these systems, stormwater can be cleansed as it moves through soils and the roots of plants, returned through soils to groundwater \(infiltration\), returned to the air \(evapotranspiration\), or captured to irrigate plants or flush toilets \(reuse\). Because these systems typically use plants to enhance or mimic natural processes, they are called “green infrastructure.” Green infrastructure contrasts with traditional “gray infrastructure,” which is Shade trees and benches support walking typically built to convey rainfall from roofs, parking lots and streets into catchbasins and pipes that have outlets at the nearest waterway.

_**Joint \(or Community\) Use Agreements**_ are formal agreements between separate government entities that allow for shared use of public property or facilities \(e.g. an agreement between a city and a school district to allow community members to use playgrounds and fields when school is not in session\).

_**Safe Routes to School**_ ****programs designate a safe path to school for children using sidewalks, bike lanes and multi-use paths. Signage identifies the route to drivers where appropriate.

_**Smart Growth**_ ****refers to development that is concentrated in and around downtowns, village centers, transit stops, or other infrastructure that provides convenient access to goods and services without relying on use of automobiles. Smart Growth is characterized by mixed-use downtowns and neighborhoods, diverse housing options and increased walkability. This compact development pattern protects open space and farmland, revitalizes downtowns, supports affordable housing options, and provides more transportation choices by directing growth to locations where higher densities can be supported.

_**Transportation Demand Management**_ ****employs strategies to decrease traffic that reduce travel demand, especially use of single-occupancy automobiles, or that redistribute travel demand.

_**Walking School Bus**_ programs organize children, led by adults such as parents or teachers, to walk to and from school as a group. Bicycle trains are similar but involve biking instead of walking.

{% tab title="Checklist" %}
#### **Municipal Policies and Programs Checklist**

_Adopted Policies and Resolutions_

* [ ] Adopt a policy to site new municipal facilities in walkable locations, and for site plans to be walkable. \(City Council/Town Meeting\)
* [ ] Adopt a policy to site new schools within walking distance of existing residential populations, 90 to focus on the renovation of existing neighborhood schools when feasible, and for school site plans to be walkable. \(School Board\)
* [ ] Adopt a policy to site public affordable and senior housing in walkable locations with easy access to shopping, services, recreation and transit. \(City Council/Town Council\)
* [ ] Adopt the Planning for a Healthier Future through the Built Environment and Community Design Resolution. \(Board of Health\)
* [ ] Adopt green and fit buildings policies for school and municipal construction projects.91 \(City Council/Town Meeting, School Board\)
