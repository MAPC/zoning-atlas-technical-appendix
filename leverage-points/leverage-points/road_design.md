# Road Design

Incorporating Complete Streets principals into local standards governing the construction and repair of municipal roads can create a safer and more inviting environment for drivers, bikers and walkers alike. While the inclusion of “reasonable provisions” for Complete Streets planning is required by state law \(MA G.L. Ch. 90E\), implementation has been a gradual process. In communities with Complete Streets policies or standards, implementation often occurs only as roads are reconstructed or repaved.

Improved road design standards can address travel lane widths, bike lanes, sidewalks, streetscapes, and other aspects of roadway infrastructure. Better road design standards encourage alternative forms of transportation, including more walking and biking, as fewer people will walk or bike along roads that feel unsafe. Enhanced road design can also result in better stormwater management and improved water quality \(see Stormwater Management section\), as well as improved air quality through the use of “cool” \(lighter color\) pavements, which reduce urban heat island effects and smog formation.`56`

Good design of sidewalks and intersections enhances safety by improving interactions between cars, pedestrians and cyclists. Reducing the number of automobile curb cuts decreases the number of points of conflict between cars, pedestrians and bikers. Narrowing road widths, especially at pedestrian crosswalks, slows vehicles down and reduces the time required for street crossings.

Street design has a significant effect on driving habits. For example, traffic can be slowed by creating artificial chicanes, narrowing road widths, installing bump-outs at crosswalks, raising crosswalks \(“tables”\), or reducing an intersection’s turning radius. Proper signage and line

painting for pedestrian crossings and bicycle lanes can alert drivers to potential interactions with pedestrians and cyclists and increase overall safety.

{% tab title="Definitions" %}
_**Complete Streets**_ are roads that are designed for all modes of transit, including vehicles, public transportation, biking and walking, and people of all abilities. Design considerations include bike or bus lanes, road narrowing, sidewalks, crosswalks, and facilities such as covered bus stops or bicycle parking.

_**Cycletracks**_ are protected bike lanes that are physically separated from automobile traffic with parked cars, curbs or bollards.

_**Urban Heat Island Effects**_ occur when pavement and buildings absorb solar energy throughout the day and radiate that heat back into the air. This is due to pavement, buildings and other structures absorbing more heat from sunlight than the natural landscape. For example, this can cause the ambient temperature of a city of one million people to be 2-5°F hotter during the day and up to 22°F hotter at night than a rural location in the same area.55

{% tab title="Checklist" %}
**Road Design Checklist**

* [ ] Adopt a community-wide Complete Streets Policy with strong, enforceable language.
* [ ] Update/establish municipal standards for Complete and Green Streets, including design standards for sidewalks, crosswalks, bicycle lanes and cycletracks, bicycle and pedestrian signage, bicycle parking, lighting, street trees, intersections, etc.
  * Require pedestrian crossings at large or complicated intersections, with pedestrian refuges where needed.
  * Revise municipal road building standards to narrow travel lane widths and include bike lanes, sidewalks and streetscaping. Place bike lanes in between parking and the sidewalk if possible, and ensure that bike lanes are clearly separated from sidewalks.
  * Ensure that street design standards comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act \(ADA\) and meet the needs of people of all abilities.
* [ ] Promote on-street parking over off-street parking to increase pedestrian safety \(by reducing automobile curb cuts\) and to facilitate smart growth \(by enabling increased development densities\).
  * Provide public parking \(on-street if possible\), reduce/eliminate private off-street parking requirements, and work to reduce automobile curb cuts \(through private property agreements, incentives and zoning regulations that limit new automobile curb cuts\).
  * Evaluate the occupancy and price of on-street parking to reduce cruising for parking spaces.
  * Consider innovative parking designs such as angled parking to improve visibility and reduce conflicts between parking cars and cyclists.
* [ ] Develop and implement a Traffic Calming Program. Establish methods to survey residents and police to identify problem spots. Pay special attention to major pedestrian corridors and areas around schools.
* [ ] Incorporate street shade trees and bike lanes \(along the street\) or cycletracks \(separate from the street\) into municipal street improvement projects.
* [ ] Consider maintenance in the design of roads and sidewalks.
* [ ] Require public input for street improvement projects prior to design so that community concerns and suggestions can be incorporated into construction plans.
* [ ] Create an Inter-Departmental Project Review Process that establishes meetings of representatives from various municipal departments/boards, including public works and public safety \(police, fire and ambulance\) personnel, to provide review and feedback on projects while still in design development.`57`
* [ ] Prioritize projects that promote walkability and bikeability in the community’s Capital Improvement Plan. Develop a long-term Capital Improvement Plan if the municipality does not have one.
* [ ] Attach pedestrian and bicycle improvements to road maintenance, not just road reconstruction projects.
* [ ] Develop roadside paths in rural areas where sidewalks may not be appropriate.
