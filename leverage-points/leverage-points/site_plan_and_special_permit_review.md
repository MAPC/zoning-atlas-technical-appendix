# Site Plan & Special Permit Review

The Site Plan Review process, which is commonly the purview of the Planning Board, uses established Site Plan Review criteria as the basis for reviewing development plans. After reviewing a site plan, the Planning Board or other reviewing authority can either approve the project or require changes prior to approval. This process can allow a community to require healthy community design criteria to be included in a project. The changes required as a result of Site

Plan Review can include improvements to plan layout, sidewalks, bicycle parking, stormwater management, etc. Due to their discretionary nature, Special Permit projects can be required to make more significant site plan changes, including amendments to the proposed use and scope of a project. However, even a Special Permit process should be guided by explicit principles and criteria that relate to larger community goals. All review decisions, whether through Site Plan or Special Permit Review, must be defensible and must serve a purpose that relates to public health, safety or well being.

Establishing the right community goals and review criteria is important. This can ensure the approval of projects that encourage walking, wheeling, biking and other outdoor activities, and that protect the quality of the outdoor environment.

{% tab title="Definitions" %}
_**Low Impact Development \(LID\)**_ ****is a stormwater management approach that mimics nature by managing stormwater as close as possible to its source. LID employs techniques such as preserving and recreating natural landscape features, minimizing imperviousness, detaining and infiltrating stormwater in dry basins, and treating stormwater as a resource rather than a waste product.

_**Site Plan Review**_ is a process for reviewing site plans according to established goals and design criteria. Criteria are established to meet environmental, health, walkability, urban design and other goals that fit new development into the larger community. The reviewing board can require reasonable changes to a plan, including road design, parking, lighting, etc., but, except in extreme cases, cannot block a plan from going forward.

_**Special Permit Review**_ is a discretionary approval for a use or project that is not allowed by-right. Massachusetts state law requires a Special Permit use to be “in harmony” with the community. The Special Permit Granting Authority “in the proper use of its discretion, is free to deny a special permit even if the facts show that such a permit could be lawfully granted.”`46`

_**Stormwater Runoff Pollution**_ is rain that falls on streets, parking lots, or other developed land, that carries pollution into lakes, rivers, streams, or other bodies of water. This can be pollutants such as oil or fuel from vehicles, fertilizers or pesticides from agricultural lands, pet waste, or soil from construction sites.

_**Urban Heat Island Effects**_ occur when pavement and buildings absorb solar energy throughout the day and radiate that heat back into the air. This is due to pavement, buildings and other structures absorbing more heat from sunlight than the natural landscape. For example, this can cause the ambient temperature of a city of one million people to be 2-5°F hotter during the day and up to 22°F hotter at night than a rural location in the same area.`47`

{% tab title="Checklists" %}
**Site Plan and Special Permit Review Checklist**

* [ ] Encourage submission of preliminary site plans \(also known as a pre-application conference\) to provide an opportunity to encourage healthy design strategies before plans are finalized.
* [ ] Create an Inter-Departmental Project Review Process that establishes meetings of representatives from various municipal departments/boards, including the Board of Health, to provide review and feedback on projects while still in design development.`48`
* [ ] Allow the Planning Board or other reviewing authority to reduce parking requirements through Site Plan or Special Permit Review based on information that demonstrates that the proposed development will have reduced parking demand.

#### _Site development plans must:_

* [ ] Provide for safe internal traffic and pedestrian flows, and provide bicycle and pedestrian connections to the larger community.
* [ ] Include site-wide sidewalk networks in large developments, and reduce on-site driving through efficient design of roads and parking areas.
* [ ] Particularly in the case of institutional uses \(including schools, churches and other community-based facilities\), make appropriate connections to the larger community, including connections to sidewalks, bike lanes, multi-use paths, etc. \(even if they will not connect to networks currently built\).
* [ ] Include bicycle parking/storage.
  * All commercial and civic developments must provide bicycle racks for customers and employees.
  * Large commercial and civic developments \(e.g. larger than 20,000 square feet\) must provide covered bicycle storage and shower facilities for employees.
  * Multifamily residential buildings must provide covered bicycle storage for at least 15 percent of all building occupants.
* [ ] Orient buildings to serve pedestrians on the street, where appropriate.
  * Place parking lots at the back or to the side of buildings, with the main entrance in the front and near the sidewalk. A secondary entrance may be oriented to the parking.
* [ ] Minimize the total paved area to decrease stormwater runoff pollution impacts on waterways, and to reduce urban heat island effects.
* [ ] Incorporate Low Impact Development \(LID\) stormwater management techniques to the extent feasible in order to protect the quality of surface waters that serve recreational and drinking water purposes.
* [ ] Provide landscaped parking lot islands \(where applicable\) and shade trees to create comfortable walking conditions and to reduce urban heat island effects.
* [ ] To the extent feasible, set aside 10 percent of all parking lot spaces for carpools and fuel efficient vehicles.
* [ ] Consider siting outdoor common areas \(e.g. shaded outdoor seating for lunch\) and exercise options where appropriate.
* [ ] Consider using light colored pavements and reflective roofing materials or green roofs in order to reduce urban heat island effects.
