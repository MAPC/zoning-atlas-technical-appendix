# Smart Growth Development

Smart growth, sometimes called compact growth, is a comprehensive land use strategy that concentrates development in and near commercial centers \(downtowns, village centers, etc.\) and infrastructure in order to create more walkable communities, protect open space and farmland, revitalize and beautify downtowns and nearby neighborhoods, and provide more housing and transportation choices. By increasing development densities in centralized locations and locating residential, commercial and civic uses within proximity of each other, smart growth increases the number of homes and destinations in walking distance, as well as associated pedestrian activity. Destinations can include work, shopping, parks, community gardens, municipal services and public transit. Higher residential densities and greater interaction among different uses enhances business vitality, supporting a greater variety of commercial services and employment opportunities within walking distances of each other and nearby neighborhoods.

Mixed-use development on a downtown street \(e.g. ground floor commercial uses with residential uses above\) is a good example of smart growth, such as on Newbury Street in Boston, State Street in Newburyport, or the Queset Commons development in Easton. Traditional neighborhoods within walking distance of mixed-use neighborhood or town centers are also a good example of smart growth. In rural communities, smart growth zoning restricts strip commercial development, allows residential units above commercial uses in the village center, and allows traditional neighborhoods near the village center. All of these examples encourage walking \(for example, from home to a café, from shop to shop, from home to work, etc.\) and lead to a healthier community. In addition, by concentrating development in areas where public infrastructure can support higher densities, urban sprawl development patterns are avoided. This preserves open space, farmland, critical environmental resources and valued rural landscapes.

Smart growth zoning tools make communities more walkable by increasing allowed development densities and broadening the mix of compatible uses permitted in an area. These zoning tools allow for smaller lot sizes, mixed-use development and multifamily housing \(e.g. duplexes, rowhomes or larger multifamily developments\). Infill development, new neighborhood centers, Transit Oriented Development \(TOD\), cluster or Open Space Residential Developments, accessory apartments, urban parks and community gardens, and mixed-use districts are all examples of smart growth. A Chapter 40R Smart Growth Overlay District is a specific zoning tool enabled through state legislation \(MA G.L. Ch. 40R\) that was developed to promote housing production and smart growth development. The commonwealth provides incentive funds for municipalities to implement 40R Smart Growth Districts, which must meet specific housing density and affordable housing requirements. ****Compact Neighborhood Zoning \(CNZ\) is a new tool similar to 40R that features different residential density and affordability requirements.

**Smart Growth principles include:**

1. Mix land use;
2. Take advantage of compact building design;
3. Create a range of housing opportunities and choices;
4. Create walkable neighborhoods;
5. Foster distinctive, attractive neighborhoods with a sense of place;
6. Preserve open space, farmland, natural beauty, and critical resources;
7. Strengthen and direct development towards existing communities;
8. Provide a variety of transportation choices;
9. Make development decisions predictable, fair, and cost effective; and
10. Encourage community collaboration in development decisions.`31`
{% endhint %}

Even in communities that are largely car dependent, smart growth development can create a more walkable community by enabling drivers to “park once” in a single district in order to accomplish multiple tasks on foot. Making just one stop to accomplish multiple tasks improves health and reduces environmental impacts. Over time, smart growth retrofits \(sometimes called suburban retrofits\) can help to make all communities and neighborhoods more walkable and less car dependent.

_**Accessory Apartments**,_ sometimes called mother-in-law units, are smaller apartments located on single-family residential properties \(e.g. an apartment over a garage or in a converted garage\). Accessory Apartments can allow older residents to live near their family members or can offer low-cost housing options that provide supplementary income to homeowners. When located near existing centers \(downtowns, village centers, etc.\), new accessory apartments provide walkable access to a variety of goods, services and recreational opportunities.

_**Chapter 40R Smart Growth Overlay District**_ is a zoning district superimposed over existing underlying zoning districts that allows for higher density development. Within a 40R District, a developer has a choice of undertaking a higher density development in accordance with the requirements of the 40R Overlay District, or may undertake a lower density development in accordance with the requirements of the underlying district. Chapter 40R Districts feature increased residential densities, may allow for mixed-uses, and may establish design standards. 40R Districts must be located near transit stations or “areas of concentrated development” such as downtowns, and must meet specific state criteria regarding allowed housing densities and required percentage of affordable housing. Communities that establish a 40R District receive a one-time incentive payment from the state based on the number of additional \(“bonus”\) residential units permitted by-right \(beyond the number of units allowed by the underlying zoning districts\), and also receive bonus payments upon the issuance an occupancy permit for each “bonus” unit. Compact Neighborhood Zoning \(CNZ\) is a new tool similar to 40R that features different residential density and affordability requirements.

_**Form-Based Code**_ is a relatively new type of zoning code that places an emphasis on building, site and community design over use regulations. In form-based codes, the physical form of the building \(including height, setbacks and design standards\) is established, while allowed uses are not as restricted as they are in standard zoning. Compared to traditional zoning codes, form- based codes set more specific requirements for the physical design characteristics of development, and are similar in some ways to a regulatory set of design standards. Form-based code can be combined with standard “Euclidian” or used-based zoning within several hybrid forms. Form-based codes are more illustrative than traditional zoning codes and are particularly appealing for use in special character districts \(e.g. downtowns, historic districts and commercial corridors\).

_**Infill**_ is new construction or redevelopment that “fills in” empty lots or adds units or uses in areas that are already developed. For example, a new infill building would be constructed in an empty lot between existing buildings. Infill most commonly occurs in and near downtown areas and is designed to increase density in order to create a more walkable, vibrant and aesthetically pleasing community. Infill replicates historic city, town and village development patterns and is an important tool for concentrating development in walkable neighborhoods rather than sprawling into undeveloped areas.

_**Mixed-Use Zoning Districts**_ allow more than one type of use on a single parcel. This typically refers to zoning that allows commercial uses on the first and sometimes second floors of a building, with the remaining floors above the commercial space zoned for residential uses. A mixed-use zoning district is not necessarily the same as a mixed-use district, which is a broader concept describing an area with a mix of complimentary commercial and residential uses where a variety of goods and services are available. Mixed-use districts can be zoned with a single Mixed- use zoning district, or may include a variety of different zoning districts. Mixed-use districts are also good candidates for form-based code.

_**Smart Growth**_ refers to development that is concentrated in and around downtowns, village centers, transit stops, or other infrastructure that provides convenient access to goods and services without relying on use of automobiles. Smart Growth is characterized by mixed-use downtowns and neighborhoods, diverse housing options and increased walkability. This compact development pattern protects open space and farmland, revitalizes downtowns, supports affordable housing options, and provides more transportation choices by directing growth to locations where higher densities can be supported.

_**Traditional Neighborhood Development**_ **\(TND\)** is characterized by homes on small lots with small setbacks. These developments, which can consist of both single family and multifamily homes, are modeled after older \(traditional\) neighborhoods near downtowns and village centers that have narrow streets, make use of on-street parking, and tend to have a more diverse mix of unit sizes and higher residential densities than newer neighborhoods.

_**Transit Orientated Development**_ **\(TOD\)** is a mix of uses clustered within walking distance \(usually ¼ mile\) of a transit station with a relatively high frequency of service. Successful TOD districts typically feature high quality pedestrian and bicycle networks, reduced parking requirements for automobiles, and public amenities in order to encourage compact multifamily homes and varied businesses.

_**Urban Sprawl**_ ****is low density, auto-oriented development that segregates residential, commercial and other uses. It is characterized by low density housing subdivisions, strip malls and shopping malls.

**Smart Growth Development Checklist**

* Assess how well your zoning regulations promote smart growth, walkability, healthy food access and physical activity.31
* Revise zoning maps and text to establish regulations that provide for diverse housing options, retail, services and employment within walkable distances. To increase walkability, amended zoning regulations should allow for increased density near downtown areas \(e.g. by reducing minimum lot sizes and/or required lot area per unit\) and should enable new infill development. Zoning map changes can be used to promote mixed-use neighborhoods with housing, schools and shopping within walking distances.
* Establish mixed-use zoning districts that allow residential units above commercial uses in downtown, village center and other appropriate locations.
* Reduce off-street parking requirements in order to allow more space in central locations to be utilized for housing, retail and other active uses \(increasing development densities\), and to reduce the negative impacts associated with an oversupply of off-street parking \(aesthetic impacts, dead spaces in central commercial areas, sprawl and increased driving impacts, reduced walkability, increased stormwater pollution, etc.\).32
  * Reduce off-street parking requirements and the number of automobile curb cuts allowed.
  * In downtowns and village centers, shift the burden of providing parking from private property owners to the municipality. Allow payments in lieu of meeting off-street parking requirements that can go into a municipal fund for public parking and transit improvements.
  * Allow the Planning Board to reduce off-street parking requirements when reduced needs are demonstrated through shared parking arrangements, mixed-uses with different peak parking times, demand management measures, etc.
  * Allow developers to set aside some portion of the space required for parking as green space that can be developed into parking later if needed.
  * Require parking to be located behind \(or to the side\) of buildings where appropriate, with the main entrance in the front and near the sidewalk for better pedestrian access and a more aesthetically pleasing streetscape.
* Adopt inverse zoning regulations such as maximum lot sizes, minimum building heights, and maximum off-street parking spaces to increase development densities.
* Allow and promote community gardens by amending the community’s zoning land use tables, establishing a community garden ordinance, and encouraging integration of community gardens into new development \(e.g. through Subdivision Regulations and Site Plan and Special Permit Review\).33
* Establish Transportation Oriented Development \(TOD\) zoning districts that create new housing within walking distance of public transit and provide walking/transit access to shopping, jobs, schools and other community resources.
* Allow accessory dwellings units. When located near existing centers \(downtowns, village centers, etc.\), new accessory apartments provide walkable access to a variety of goods, services and recreational opportunities. Accessory units can also create low- cost housing options that provide supplementary income to homeowners.
* Allow Cluster Residential Developments \(also known as Open Space Residential Developments\) that preserve open space and provide hiking and other recreational opportunities in neighborhoods.
* Utilize Chapter 40R Smart Growth or Compact Neighborhood Zoning Overlay Districts to increase residential densities and allow mixed-use development near shopping and public transit.
* Establish a Traditional Neighborhood Development \(TND\) Zoning Overlay District to allow new neighborhood developments that are modeled after older neighborhoods characterized by walkability, a diverse mix of housing options, and higher residential densities.
* Undertake a comprehensive Smart Growth Zoning Overhaul, reviewing and revising the following as needed to implement smart growth goals: Zoning Map, Table of Land Uses, Table of Dimensional Standards, Off-Street Parking Regulations, Site Development Standards, Site Plan and Special Permit Review, Form-Based Codes \(in special districts or for entire municipality\)
* Offer tax incentives \(or, for nonprofit entities, lower payments in lieu of taxes\) to new private educational facilities and other private institutional uses to site their facilities in walkable locations.
* Use tax incentives such as District Improvement Financing \(DIF\) to encourage private investment in appropriate locations.
