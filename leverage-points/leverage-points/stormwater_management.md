# Stormwater Management

The health of a community’s water includes not only the drinking water supply, but also the quality of surface waters used for recreational purposes, including lakes, rivers and streams. Pollution from stormwater runoff directly impacts surface water quality and whether it is safe to boat or swim in a given water body.

Traditionally, stormwater management systems have been designed to remove runoff from developed areas as quickly as possible, with little concern for other effects. This traditional approach creates considerable water pollution and flooding impacts. As stormwater runoff is collected and channeled to underground pipes, it carries pollutants that are discharged directly to local water bodies, including sediments, nutrients \(e.g. from fertilizers that have been applied to lawns\), pesticides, bacteria \(e.g. from pet waste\), and oil and heavy metals \(e.g. from automobiles\). Sometimes pollutants \(e.g. used oil, paint thinners, restaurant grease\) are illegally dumped directly into storm drains. Where Combined Sewer Overflow \(CSO\) systems are still in pace, large rain events cause raw sewage to flow directly into local rivers and streams.

There are many documented health impacts associated with stormwater pollution. The most acute human health impacts result from fecal coliform bacteria in surface waters, which result from nutrient pollution and commonly exceed standards for recreation. Exposure to bacteria and parasites from swimming and other recreation in water contaminated with stormwater runoff causes various illnesses, including ear and eye discharges, skin rashes, and gastrointestinal problems.

Today, communities are thinking of better ways to manage stormwater, ideally before the water reaches the drainage system. One significant management goal is to reduce peak flows, or the largest volume of runoff that occurs at a given time after a rain event. This reduces the amount of pollutants that are carried to nearby water bodies. In locations that still have Combined Sewer Overflow \(CSO\) systems, peak flow reduction reduces the frequency with which the volume of the stormwater/sewage mixture exceeds wastewater treatment plant capacity and must be discharged directly without treatment into local water bodies. In addition to more traditional approaches to reduce peak flows \(e.g. detention basins, which hold and then slowly release water after a rain event\), new Low Impact Development \(LID\) approaches such as rain gardens hold water and infiltrate it into the ground, reducing the total quantity of runoff that reaches the stormwater system.  By improving stormwater management, a community can create healthier waterways that allow residents to safely enjoy boating and swimming activities.

{% tab title="Definitions" %}
_**Combined Sewer Overflow \(CSO\)**_ ****systems are older water management systems that collect both stormwater runoff and wastewater \(sewage\) using the same network of pipes. After small rain events, these combined sewers bring a stormwater/sewage mixture to wastewater treatment plants for treatment prior to discharge in local water bodies. However, after large rain events, stormwater overloads the system, causing the stormwater/sewage mixture to flow directly into rivers and North Street, Pittsfield, MA.

Most locations are now served by separate sewer and stormwater systems, but some CSO systems are still connected, as it is an expensive process to separate the systems.

_**Green Infrastructure**_ ****consists of natural or engineered systems \(including rain gardens, bioswales, green roofs and cisterns\) that capture and control stormwater near to where it falls. In these systems, stormwater can be cleansed as it moves through soils and the roots of plants, returned through soils to groundwater \(infiltration\), returned to the air \(evapotranspiration\), or captured to irrigate plants or flush toilets \(reuse\). Because these systems typically use plants to enhance or mimic natural processes, they are called “green infrastructure.” Green infrastructure contrasts with traditional “gray infrastructure,” which is typically built to convey rainfall from roofs, parking lots and streets into catchbasins and pipes that have outlets at the nearest waterway.

_**Green Roofs**_ incorporate soil and vegetation into a structure’s rooftop system. These systems can range from thin soils with moss up to thick soils capable of supporting micro-farms. The main benefits of green roofs are enhanced stormwater management, insulating properties, and UV protection for roof membranes.

_**Green Streets**_ ****include green infrastructure into the overall design of the roadway. Instead of relying solely on storm drains, green streets incorporate techniques including permeable pavements, vegetated swales, and other systems that mimic natural processes to reduce the amount of runoff that is introduced into the stormwater system.

_**Gross Floor Area**_ ****is a calculation of the amount of usable floor area of a structure. This is sometimes used in zoning regulations to determine how much usable floor space is allowed in a particular zone. This is often related to Floor to Area Ratio \(FAR\) which is a ratio of the gross floor area of a building to the actual size of the parcel it is built on. In some municipalities, an accessible roof counts toward the Gross Floor Area calculation. Note: The exact definition of what is and what is not included in this calculation varies by municipality.

_**Low Impact Development \(LID\)**_ is an approach to land development that mimics nature by managing stormwater as close to its source as possible. LID employs techniques such as preserving or recreating natural landscape features and minimizing the amount of impervious surface area to create site drainage that treats stormwater as a resource \(through reuse or infiltration back into the ground\), rather than a waste product.

_**Rain Gardens**_ are areas designed to collect and infiltrate water into the ground quickly, redirecting water that would normally drain into the stormwater system. The water is filtered by vegetation and soil as the water infiltrates either into the ground, or if the soil is not suitable, into a below-ground pipe connected to a larger system.

_**Stormwater Utilities**_ are fees that charge users for municipal stormwater services, including maintenance and upgrades to a community’s stormwater management infrastructure. Note: This term can be confusing because a stormwater or sewer utility is also the organizational entity that is in charge of collecting the fees and providing the service.

{% tab title="Checklist" %}
#### **Stormwater Management Checklist**

* [ ] Adopt a stormwater bylaw/ordinance.
  * Require a large proportion of stormwater runoff to be infiltrated, and require that post-development runoff volumes and rates do not exceed pre-development conditions.
  * Give preference to Low Impact Development \(LID\) management techniques where appropriate.
  * Include standards for small projects, and encourage residential projects to manage stormwater with rain gardens.
  * Develop standards for improvement at redevelopment sites.
  * Minimize pooling of water, discourage large retention ponds and require retention ponds to drain within a maximum of 2-3 days to eliminate mosquito breeding.
* [ ] Create a stormwater management program responsible for systematic efforts to improve the municipality’s stormwater services and local water quality.
* [ ] Establish a stormwater utility to charge for municipal stormwater management services \(just as utility fees are charged for providing drinking water, sewers, and other public services\) and to fund the local stormwater management program.
* [ ] Establish a stormwater rebate program to promote improved stormwater management practices at existing properties. Rebate incentives can be provided through stormwater utility fee reductions or direct rebate payments.
* [ ] Adopt a Green Streets Policy to ensure systematic stormwater management improvements on municipal roadways. Also see section on Road Design.
* [ ] Encourage Low Impact Development \(LID\) techniques through Site Plan Review and Special Permit criteria, as well as Subdivision Regulations.
* [ ] Incentivize green roofs through zoning regulations \(e.g. through density bonuses or by exempting accessible green roofs from Gross Floor Area calculations\).
* [ ] Within landscaping regulations \(typically part of site development regulations in zoning\), require or encourage the use of plants that need little watering or fertilizer.
* [ ] Establish source reduction regulations, including bans on use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and coal tar sealants.
* [ ] Install green infrastructure \(e.g. rain gardens, green roofs\) on municipal properties, and highlight municipal green infrastructure projects as public educational examples.
* [ ] Create/Participate in surface water quality monitoring programs and public education explaining the link between stormwater management and water quality.
