# Subdivision Regulations

The Subdivision Regulations established by a community have a dramatic effect on the characteristics of subdivision developments, and, by extension, affect community health. Perhaps most importantly, Subdivision Regulations govern the design of new roadways. Requiring sidewalks and shade trees helps create a safe and comfortable pedestrian environment that promotes walking. Requiring narrower roads and traffic calming measures creates safer streets for pedestrians and enables children to travel safely and to be more active. This is especially true if a subdivision sets aside land for a playground or community park. Connecting sidewalks and bike lanes to larger networks creates additional opportunities for physical activity and allows people to access the larger community without having to rely on an automobile. For example, connections to sidewalk networks can allow children to walk or bike to school.

A community’s Board of Health can play a significant role in the subdivision approval process. The Subdivision Control Law gives a Board of Health 45 days to approve a subdivision design or return the plans to the applicant with required changes, along with specific reasons for the needed changes. `50` The Planning Board then cannot approve the plan without the Board of Health’s changes. Failure of the Board of Health to submit its report with the 45 days constitutes approval of the plan.

_**Approval Not Required**_ **\(ANR\)** refers to subdivisions that result in new parcels with frontage along existing roadways. This type of subdivision does not require approval by the local Planning Board.

_**Complete Streets**_ are roads that are designed for all modes of transit, including vehicles, public transportation, biking and walking, and people of all abilities. Design considerations include bike or bus lanes, road narrowing, sidewalks, crosswalks, and facilities such as covered bus stops or bicycle parking.

_**Low Impact Development \(LID\)**_ ****is a stormwater management approach that mimics nature by managing stormwater as close as possible to its source. LID employs techniques such as preserving and recreating natural landscape features, minimizing imperviousness, detaining and infiltrating stormwater in dry basins, and treating stormwater as a resource rather than a waste product.

_**Stormwater Pollution**_ ****occurs when rain that falls on streets, parking lots and other land carries pollutants into lakes, rivers, streams or other water bodies. Pollutants can include oil and fuel from vehicles, fertilizers and pesticides from yards or agricultural lands, pet waste, and soil picked up by erosion.

_**Subdivision**_ ****is the division of a tract of land into two or more smaller parcels. A subdivision can occur along an existing road or can create a new road.

_**Subdivision Regulations**_ set rules that determine the characteristics of a land subdivision development. For example, Subdivision Regulations typically address road design, utilities, open space and stormwater drainage. In Massachusetts, Subdivision Regulations are adopted by a majority vote of a municipality’s Planning Board or, in some small towns without a Planning Board, by the Board of Selectmen.

_**Urban Heat Island Effects**_ occur when pavement and buildings absorb solar energy throughout the day and radiate that heat back into the air. This is due to pavement, buildings and other structures absorbing more heat from sunlight than the natural landscape. For example, this can cause the ambient temperature of a city of one million people to be 2-5°F hotter during the day and up to 22°F hotter at night than a rural location in the same area.`49`

{% tab title="Checklist" %}
**Subdivision Regulations Checklist**

* [ ] Require sidewalks.
  * In rural environments or other locations where sidewalks on both sides of the street may not make sense, a sidewalk on one side of the street is acceptable.
* [ ] Require interconnecting street and sidewalk networks.
  * If a dead-end is created, require the subdivision design to allow for streets to be connectable in the future.
  * Where applicable, require multi-use paths at the end of dead-end streets that connect to a larger network of pathways.
  * Require bicycle and pedestrian linkages to nearby public ways.
* [ ] Design driveways to minimize pedestrian impacts.
  * Encourage shared/common driveways to reduce the number of automobile curb cuts.
  * Require driveways to rise up to the level of the sidewalk instead of designing the sidewalk to descend to the level of the driveway.
* [ ] Narrow road widths and the turning radius at intersections to reduce traffic speeds and the crossing distance at intersections. \(Reducing the total amount of pavement also decreases stormwater runoff pollution impacts on waterways as well as urban heat island effects.\)
* [ ] Require Low Impact Development \(LID\) stormwater management techniques to protect the quality of surface waters that serve recreational and drinking water purposes.
* [ ] Encourage a preliminary meeting with the Planning Board/Department prior to subdivision design to review potential healthy design strategies.
* [ ] Encourage submission of Preliminary Subdivision Plans to provide an opportunity to encourage healthy design strategies before plans are finalized.
* [ ] Create an Inter-Departmental Project Review Process that establishes meetings of representatives from various municipal departments/boards, including the Board of Health, to provide review and feedback on projects while still in design development.
* [ ] Require a set-aside of future parkland \(even if only temporary, as required by Massachusetts law\), to give the homeowner’s association, municipality or other entity time to acquire it.`51` Encourage a community garden set-aside for subdivisions with small lot sizes.
* [ ] Require roads to be designed to “Complete Streets” standards, with equal attention to the needs of automobiles, cyclists and pedestrians.
* [ ] Require shade trees along pedestrian and bicycle pathways.
* [ ] Require traffic and environmental impact studies for subdivisions over 5 units.
* [ ] Require an analysis of pedestrian circulation for subdivisions over 15 to 20 units.
