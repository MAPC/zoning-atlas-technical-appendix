# Specifies few priority fields and values cannot be easily estimated

## Example 3: Municipality specifies few priority fields and values cannot be easily estimated 

A few municipal zoning codes we interpreted specified only two or three of the priority fields we collected and those fields were not easily estimated using other fields specified in the code. For one such municipality, the most complex of the 101 we interpreted, we had to make a number of assumptions in order to estimate values for the Atlas. The municipality specifies maximum building height for about two-thirds of their districts, and maximum floor-area-ratio for most but not all of them. They specify dwelling units allowed per acre for none. In order to estimate the missing values, we oThey specify minimum lot size for only 12 percent of districts
