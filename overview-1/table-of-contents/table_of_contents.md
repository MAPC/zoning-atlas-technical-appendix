          <li>The State of Massachusetts is ranked 10th overall in the <em>2012 State of Well-Being: Community, State, and Congressional Districts Well-Being Reports</em>.
            While the state ranked 1st in Basic Access (to necessities crucial to well-being),
            and 7th in Life Evaluation (a self- evaluation of present life situation
            and anticipated life situation five years from now using the Cantril Self-Anchoring
            Striving Scale), Massachusetts ranked 43rd in Mental Health (stress, happiness,
            etc.).<code>99</code>

          <li>Massachusetts is making progress regarding obesity and is 4.7 percentage
            points better than the national average (In 2013, 27.6 percent of the national
            adult population was obese versus 22.9 percent in Massachusetts).100 Even
            though there is progress in rates of childhood obesity (the percentage
            of overweight and obese Massachusetts public school students dropped from
            34.3 percent in 2009 to 30.6% in 2013) much more work needs to be done.<code>101</code>

          <li>Healthcare costs are greatly impacted by health. Obesity is associated
            with a 36 percent increase in inpatient/outpatient healthcare costs and
            a 77 percent increase in prescription medication costs.102 Being overweight
            increases yearly per-person healthcare costs by $125, while obesity increases
            these costs by $395.103 One study of individuals aged 15 and over without
            physical limitations found that average annual direct medical costs were
            $1,019 for those who were physically active and $1,349 for those who reported
            being inactive.<code>104</code>

        <ul>
          <li>Obesity rates and health indicators vary considerably among Massachusetts
            communities. In 2005, the percentage of the population that was obese ranged
            from 30 percent in Taunton (with a Median Household Income of $53,000)
            to 11 percent in Brookline (with a Median Household Income of $95,000).105
            In 2010, there were 610 emergency room visits for asthma-related issues
            per 100,000 persons statewide,106 but in Springfield this number was almost
            triple the state average at 1,754 asthma-related emergency room visits
            per 100,000 people.<code>107</code>
