# Understanding Municipal Processes

The cities and towns of Massachusetts have different forms of government. Most towns have a Select Board and a Town Meeting \(or multiple town meetings as deemed necessary by the Select Board\) at which a majority of residents present make decisions, voting on land use regulations, proposed budgets and other important aspects of local government. Some larger towns have a representative Town Meeting, which means that elected Town Meeting members are the only people who can vote on policy and regulatory decisions. Some towns also have Town Managers or Town Administrators. Most cities in the Commonwealth have a Mayor and a City Council, and some cities also have a City Manager. It is important to know which kind of government you are going to be working with, as your strategy to leverage change will vary. For additional information on Massachusetts government and details on our 351 cities and towns, visit [www.mma.org,](http://www.mma.org/) the website of the Massachusetts Municipal Association \(MMA\).

If you are a government official, you will probably want to start your work within the local government structure to leverage change. If you go first to elected officials or advocacy groups, you might end up alienating your colleagues. However, if you try to work from within and fail, you might decide to work from the outside in.

If you are an advocate working to make your city healthier, you might start by speaking with a city councilperson for a specific area or ward, or with an at-large councilperson. You might also try working with the appropriate professional staff or Boards, most likely planners/Planning Board, engineers/Boards of Public ****Works, or the Public Health Director/Board of Public Health.

**Think Globally, Act Locally**

In Massachusetts, community design is largely planned and regulated on the local level. Each town has its own set of laws that governs land-use and basic site design. Zoning says what kinds of uses \(e.g. residential, commercial, or industrial uses\) can happen where in a community. It also regulates the basic dimensions of lots and buildings. Subdivision regulations set standards for how land can be divided and often include standards for roads, sidewalks, etc. Subdivision regulations set the character of new neighborhoods. Modifying these local laws can have a significant impact on how a community develops and thereby the health of its population.

Likewise, transportation improvement projects are often initiated and managed at the local level. Local advocacy can make a difference between whether a project happens or not.

When one wants to make a positive change in community design, it makes sense to act locally.

In the case of a town, ideas can be brought to professional staff or the boards they serve, or to members of the Select Board. In some smaller communities, professional staff may be limited to a Town Clerk \(full or part-time\) and Highway, Police and Fire Departments. Most communities have a Planning Board and a Board of Health.

If you are unsure whom to contact, check the municipality’s website \(nearly all 351 cities and towns in the Commonwealth have websites that can be found through a search engine or the Massachusetts Municipal Association website\), or stop in at your Town or City Hall.

Regardless of who you are or what kind of a government you are functioning in, it is essential for you to understand your municipality’s existing rules and regulations as well as the established processes for changing them. For an overview of land use regulations in Massachusetts, visit the Massachusetts Executive Office of Housing and Economic Development \(EOHED\) website at: [http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/planning/zoning-resources.html](http://www.mass.gov/hed/community/planning/zoning-resources.html)

The public can be a powerful force in transforming a community and also in directing the kind of transformation desired. Encouraging as much public involvement as possible from all community stakeholders will give many people a voice and build momentum for a healthier community. Ideas for change may come from children at a local elementary school who want to be able to ride their bikes to school, from older adults who cannot find a nice place to walk, or perhaps from parents who want healthier food served in school cafeterias. Regardless of who originates ideas to make your community healthier, they may need assistance in bringing ideas before the appropriate board or committee. An argument that always gets the municipality’s attention is “this idea will save us money.”

The information provided in this toolkit includes processes for ensuring that health is considered in municipal planning decisions. There are times however when pursuing the provided strategies may not be sufficient \(for example when a community is facing a decision on a large proposed development or a significant change to municipal bylaws\) and a more focused assessment of health impacts is warranted. Health Impact Assessment \(HIA\) is a tool for doing this. HIA is a “combination of procedures, methods, and tools by which a project, program, policy, or legislative proposal may be judged for its potential effects on the health of a population and the distribution of these effects within it”.28 HIAs have been gaining popularity in Massachusetts, and there are now several organizations with the expertise to complete HIAs. However, while HIA is an important tool, putting into practice the principles outlined in this toolkit mitigate the need for it. For more information on Health Impact Assessment, visit: [www.mass.gov/healthycommunitydesign](http://www.mass.gov/healthycommunitydesign) and [www.humanimpact.org](http://www.humanimpact.org/).

This toolkit is designed to be a part of the healthy community development process, and we look forward to hearing your suggestions on how to make it better.
